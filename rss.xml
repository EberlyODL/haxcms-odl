          <![CDATA[ <p>
  Louis Leblonde is the Director of Online Education in Physics. With a strong
  passion for all things education (research and online), he teaches large
  enrollment intro physics courses and has worked tirelessly to enhance them
  with engaging, accessible, and innovative materials.
</p>
<p>
  Louis excells in creating unique online course experiences to enrich
  face-to-face classes and currently he is working on developing a hands-on lab
  for future physics online courses.
</p>
<p>
  Specifically, Louis has filmed a number of creative instructional lab videos.
  The videos feature Louis performing a variety of experiments that would help
  students visualize difficult concepts online.

<p>
  Moreover, when Loius isn't pouring over his course materials for quality and
  effectiveness, he's working to create resources for fellow faculty to improve
  the college.

      <title>Drupal Camp NJ: Progressively Decoupled Drupal for Everyone</title>
      <link>/blog-posts/2-10-20</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>
  Recently, the Office of Digital Learning (Eberly College of Science at Penn
  State) participated in the ninth consecutive
  <a href="https://www.drupalcampnj.org/" target="_blank">Drupal Camp NJ</a>
  , hosted at Princeton University. The weekend witnessed developers and
  industry professionals collaborating on a number of Drupal initiatives through
  informative presentations, networking opportunities, and engaging training
  sessions.
</p>
<p>
  Demonstrating their progress since Drupal Camp NJ 2019, the ODL team continued
  where they left off with their discussion on decoupling Drupal. Specifically,
  Michal Potter and I joined
  <a href="https://www.elmsln.org/" target="_blank">ELMS:LN</a> lead developer,
  Bryan Ollendyke (College of Arts and Architecture - Penn State) and Rebecca
  Goodman (Branch Chief, Web at U.S.
  <a href="https://www.archives.gov/" target="_blank"
    >National Archives and Records Administration</a
  >
  / NARA) to present work on web components.
</p>
<p>
  Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create custom,
  reusable, HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Because they’re built
  using web standards, they will work across all modern browsers and within any
  JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML. The team has been
  actively working to implement web components across a number of projects,
  including a custom suite of authoring tools (<a
    href="https://haxtheweb.org/"
    target="_blank"
    >HAX</a
  >
  ), Drupal, WordPress, Grav CMS and more.
</p>
<p>
  Bryan Ollendyke jump-started the conversation with a great introduction and
  Michael Potter and I showcased our implementation of web components across
  several custom web themes. The highlight of the talk was Rebecca Goodman
  announcing that her web team at NARA had started implementing web components
  into their work-flow by successfully placing a branding bar across several of
  their existing web properties.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, feedback was extremely positive. The audience contained a wide
  variety of technical backgrounds. Developers quickly understood how they could
  reduce technical debt across their projects, graphic designers saw how their
  interactions with Content Management Systems could be simplified, and project
  managers realized how this approach could reduce timelines of maintenance and
  enhancement across the board.
</p>
<p>
  Check out our presentation below and see how web components can revolutionize
  your next web project:

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>
  The 2020 Horizon Report has just been released, taking a look at what may be
  impacting teaching and learning in the future. This report is very important
  in the digital world as it helps stakeholders learn, plan, and act on
  initiatives or developments that may influence higher education. The report
  summarizes trends that are unfolding as we speak: Social, Technological,
  Economic, Higher Education, and Political. Additionally, it takes a look at
  emerging technologies and practices that will have significant impact on the
  future of postsecondary education.
</p>
<p>
  The Office of Digital Learning is familiar with many of these emerging
  technologies, including NGDLEs, AI, Analytics, and online education. We hope
  you have a moment or two to download and look at the report. As always, we are
  interested in your thoughts and ways you think we can have an impact on the
  future of higher education.

      <title>Get Decoupled at Drupal Camp NJ</title>
      <link>/blog-posts/2-6-19</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>
  This past weekend (February 1-3) the Office of Digital Learning (Eberly
  College of Science at Penn State) participated in the eighth consecutive
  <a href="https://www.drupalcampnj.org/" target="_blank">Drupal Camp NJ</a>



, hosted at Princeton University. The annual event brings
  developers and industry professionals from varying backgrounds and
  skill-levels together to share all things <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>


 through engaging
  presentations, co-working sessions, and networking.
</p>
<p>
  This year there were a number of great discussions to get involved with, but
  one topic continued to dominate the conversation - decoupling Drupal.
  Decoupling Drupal essentially means separating Drupal’s front-end (theme
  layer) from it’s back-end (data/content layer) using a custom JavaScript
  framework. While there are still some discussions as to which framework is
  ‘best’ when decoupling Drupal, the general consensus is that the decoupled
  method is becoming an industry-wide movement.
</p>
<p>
  Jesus Manuel Olivas (Head of Products at <a href="https://weknowinc.com/" target="_blank">weKnow</a>

) showcased decoupling tools
  like <a href="http://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>
 and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/tome" target="_blank">Tome</a>
. These tools assist in creating static sites by
  decoupling Drupal’s theme and just using Drupal for content creation.
</p>
<p>
  Saurabh Chugh and Surendra Singh hosted a discussion, ‘Decoupling Patterns,
  Services and creating an enterprise level editorial experience’ where they
  also emphasized using decoupled applications to display content.

<p>
  Our team demonstrated decoupled development when Michal Potter and Charles
  Lavera joined ELMS:LN lead developer, Bryan Ollendyke (College of Arts and
  Architecture - Penn State) to present work on web components. Specifically,
  the trio discussed the tooling they use to quickly generate and publish their
  components onto the web (<a href="https://github.com/elmsln/wcfactory" target="_blank">WCFactory</a>
 / Drupal <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/webcomponents" target="_blank">webcomponents module</a>
). In
  addition, Bryan explored the future of content-authoring with a completely
  headless authoring experience called HAX.

      <title>H5P - Documentation Tool</title>
      <link>/blog-posts/11-19-18</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <div>Are you searching for a creative, interactive, and engaging way to have
    students submit details about an
    assignment or project they’re working on? Would you like this information to
    be exported to a nicely
    formatted text document instantly? Look no further! H5P’s Documentation Tool
    allows you to create a
    project outline complete with instructions and assessment possibilities. In
    this video, I set up a simple
    demonstration that identifies some basic goals while also asking users to
    supply their insight as they traverse
    through each step. Specifically, we look over the general settings of the
    tool and work through building an
    example that will help users scaffold out a detailed steps-to-completion
    outline, create a plan of attack, and
    organize / assess individual goals and contributions. At the end, we'll
    review the different ways we can
    implement this newly created content into your website. Check it out!

  I have always been obsessed with visuals. When I was a kid I would go through
  my mom’s magazines, find an image I loved, check with my mom to make sure she
  didn’t need the article on the back, then clip it out and safely tuck it away
  in a flat, waxed-cardboard box under my bed - only to find out years later
  that my mom secretly snuck in my room and downsized my collection to keep it
  under control.
  <br />
  <br />
</div>
<div>
  These days, I apply my passion for visual arts to graphic design and
  photography. I soak up inspiration all around me, and still tear out magazine
  ads and tuck them away for reference. I strive to visually present the facts
  and discipline of science with creativity, quality, technology and whenever
  possible… a bit of humor. I am always looking for new ways to approach
  courses, graphics, and content to successfully visually communicate concepts
  with an audience.

      <title>Chem 810</title>
      <link>/syllabi/chem810</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  CHEM 810 is the first in a sequence of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
  (LC-MS) courses designed to fill an industry need to provide high-quality
  instruction in LC theory and application. The course topics include the
  background and history of chromatography; fundamental concepts in
  chromatographic separations; basic instrumentation; column, particle and phase
  chemistry; and basic method development. The course material is designed to
  increase student understanding of both the analytical instrument used in the
  laboratory and the principles underlying the measurements. The course
  specifically caters to the needs of the analytical chemical industry and
  individuals newly hired into introductory sample management/preparation and
  quality assurance/quality control positions within companies using liquid
  chromatographic techniques.
</p>
<p>
  There is no required textbook. The bulk of the course uses algebra to solve
  sets of equations. You should feel comfortable doing this and capable of doing
  this in a timely manner. You will also use Microsoft Excel for a number of
  assignments. You should feel comfortable preparing spreadsheets, preparing
  plots, and adding trendlines. If you do not feel confident in these areas talk
  with the instructor early in the semester so you can acquire some proficiency.
  Don’t fall behind. Later material in this course depends strongly on earlier
  material and procrastination can quickly lead to a difficult situation. You
  should set aside regular times during the week for focused study.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>After successfully completing this course, the student will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Identify the factors (and associated equations) which influence the
    efficiency and resolution of a chromatographic separation and be able to
    quantify these contributions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify which factors influence column performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify the chemical interactions (intermolecular forces) which give rise
    to analyte separation and use this knowledge to develop isocratic or
    gradient-based elution methods.
  </li>
  <li>
    Evaluate the instrumental contributions (extra-column) to the resolution and
    efficiency of chromatographic separations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify and describe the function of each component of an HPLC system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Design an SPE sample pretreatment method appropriate for the analyte(s) of
    interest.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Discussions</h2>
<p>
  The first activity is to engage in a class discussion related to that week’s
  assigned problems – questions concerning clarification, problem-solving
  strategies, and placing the questions into a broader context (when/how/why
  might such a problem be useful in the practical application of LC). You must
  post an initial response to any one or all assigned problems by 11:59 PM
  Wednesday of each week. You will then respond to at least two of your
  colleagues during the week. You must post your initial response before you are
  able to respond to others. Even though it is due on Wednesday at the latest,
  the earlier you can post your initial response during the week offers everyone
  a greater opportunity to respond to others. As with any academic work,
  procrastination makes the process more difficult in the long run. Responses to
  your peers, along with your answers to the assigned problems, are due no later
  than 11:59 PM Sunday each week.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Grading</h2>
<p>
  The course website provides numerous example problems with detailed
  instructor-guided solutions and practice problems for which answer keys are
  provided once an initial answer attempt is submitted. No grade is assigned to
  the instructor-guided example problems or the practice problems.
</p>
<p>
  Each week, a set of 5-10 proficiency- and mastery-level questions associated
  with each module will be assigned. Students are encouraged to discuss the
  questions with each other and the instructor (see Course Schedule above) prior
  to submitting their answers. Answer keys are not provided.
</p>
<p>
  There are a total of 4 exams, one at the end of each module. Each exam is
  comprehensive in scope. A minimum score of 70% is required on an end-of-module
  exam before a student is eligible to access the subsequent module (e.g.., a
  score of 70% is required on Exam 1 – the exam at the end of Module 1 – before
  a student is permitted access to the material in Module 2).
</p>
<p>
  In fairness to the instructor who must grade the required course work, and to
  the other students, late work will not be accepted. Think about this. A
  substantial number of late or missing work will affect your grade. Stay caught
  up.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Arranging a Proctor</h2>
<p>
  You will need to secure a proctor in order to take exams in this course. A
  proctor will not automatically be assigned to you; rather, you must make the
  necessary contacts to secure a professional who will serve in this capacity.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Contact a person who meets the qualifications and ask him or her to proctor
    your exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    Student Services must approve your proctor before any exams can be taken.
    Please see instructions for securing a
    <a
      style="text-decoration: none; color:#e2801e;"
      href="https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/courses/proctored-exams"
      target="_blank"
      >suitable proctor</a
    >
    . While many proctors will serve on a voluntary basis, you are responsible
    for paying any expenses incurred in retaining a proctor.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must complete a Proctor Information Form and submit the completed form
    with the proctor verification documentation. Note: If your proctor has been
    previously approved by the World Campus during a prior course within two
    years, you do not need to obtain verification. World Campus retains proctor
    information on file for two years.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your proctor does not meet the required specifications, Student Services
    will notify you within 5 to 7 business days.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will need to complete an Exam Request Form for each exam. Contact your
    proctor to confirm the date, time, and location of your exam(s). Complete
    the form 3 weeks prior to your scheduled exam to allow for processing the
    request and mailing exams to proctors. If you are located outside the United
    States, in order to allow adequate time for mailing, please plan to request
    your exam earlier than 3 weeks prior to the exam week.
  </li>
  <li>Contact Student Services if you cannot take a scheduled exam.</li>

<p>
  Forensic science is the application of scientific principles and practices to
  matters of the law.
</p>
<p>
  This course introduces students to the field of forensic science and
  criminalist with focus on the collection, examination, evaluation, and
  interpretation of evidence. Following a single case over the semester, the
  course will review the basic applications of selected forensic science
  disciplines and will explore the underlying scientific principals and methods
  used within each. The capabilities and limitations of the forensic sciences
  will be illustrated, as well as the ways in which science contributes to the
  resolution of social and legal disputes.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Describe crime scene procedures and technologies used to reveal, collect,
    process, and transport crime scene evidence.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify the role of the criminalist within the broad scope of forensic
    science and science in general.
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe the forensic roles that scientists from the fields outside of
    criminalistics play in the investigation and criminal justice process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Explain categories of evidence (direct, circumstantial, testimonial), their
    limitations, and value in a criminal investigation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe the necessity of photography in all stages of the forensic science
    process, from crime scene to court room, and its dual purpose as both
    evidence and documentation in case work.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compare the generalist versus specialist philosophies of forensic science,
    and explain how each informs the way forensic science is approached.
  </li>
  <li>
    Explain how to identify and scientifically examine different types of
    physical evidence, such as glass, soil, hairs, fibers, paint, controlled
    substances or drugs, blood, DNA, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe identification, enhancement, collection, and analysis techniques
    for impression and pattern evidence.
  </li>
  <li>
    List characteristics of handwriting and document analysis.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recall historical developments and landmarks of forensic science.
  </li>
  <li>
    Illustrate critical thinking by obtaining results and collecting facts, and
    then drawing conclusions from those results and making decisions based on
    the facts presented.
  </li>
  <li>
    Demonstrate knowledge of the underlying scientific principles for analyses
    performed and instruments used in forensic science and the science lab.
  </li>
  <li>
    Demonstrate quantitative literacy by solving numerical problems and
    performing numerical manipulations, and interpreting tabulated, graphical,
    and/or statistical data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify the limitations of forensic science in what it can and cannot
    prove.
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe the differences between presumptive and confirmatory testing, and
    demonstrate knowledge of the appropriate application of each to evidence.
  </li>
  <li>
    Relate forensic science principles and technological advances to real-world
    applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    Explain the importance of ethics in science.
  </li>
  <li>
    Summarize how the legal field influences forensic science and vise-versa.
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe the role of forensic science in the criminal justice system, as
    well as its role in society at large.
  </li>

<p>
  It is HIGHLY recommended that you purchase the e-book. You can buy it on
  amazon.com. You do not need a kindle to read the book - just download the free
  kindle app onto your computer or device.
</p>
<p>
  The Kindle version costs approx. $6 USD and can be purchased on

  If you choose to buy the paper book instead of the e-book, no dude date
  extensions will be granted for late work because your book has has not arrived
  yet. The paper book costs about $30 USD, so it is remarkably more expensive
  than the e-book. If you still decide to purchase the physical copy, make sure
  you purchase the second edition and not the first. They are not the same. All
  online instructor provided reading and activities on the Canvas website,
  unless specifically stated to the contrary, are testable materials.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Reading</h2>
<p>
  Each module contains assigned reading. Some of the reading is from your
  textbook and some will be from online articles, websites, or content provided
  by the instructor on the course content website. All material from the reading
  is testable unless otherwise indicated.
</p>
<p>
  If you have a paper book, the page numbers are listed. If you are using an
  e-book (recommended), the page numbers may differ from the physical paper
  book. In that case, the chapter titles and/or headings are given to provide
  you with starting and stopping points.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Online Labs or Activities</h2>
<p>
  Online labs or other activities help emphasize important points from your
  reading, or help expand your understanding of the science being used to
  examine evidence. Most of this content is hosted on third-party websites that
  we do not control. If the content on one of these websites becomes unavailable
  or you have trouble accessing it, email the instructor immediately for
  assistance. We will help you troubleshoot as best we can. If you choose to
  skip the activity and move on to the quiz without seeking assistance, and are
  unable to answer quiz questions because of it, points will not be given back.
  You MUST contact one of us to troubleshoot before "giving up and moving on" if
  you cannot access a site in order for points to be granted for missed
  questions.
</p>
<p>
  If you do not already have a YouTube account, you may need to create one to
  watch many of the videos.
</p>
<p>
  The content of these labs and activities is testable material unless otherwise
  indicated.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Case Notes and Written Work</h2>
<p>
  In modules 1-11 you will have homework assignments in the form of case notes.
  While each module's case notes covers a different area of the crime scene or
  crime lab (toxicology, DNA, drugs, etc.), they are all part of the same case
  and will all have the same case number – PSUCL-01.
</p>
<p>
  Most of these assignments require you to fill in the provided
  worksheets/outlines and then submit the work for grading on Canvas. All of the
  case notes must be typewritten and submitted as a Microsoft Word or PDF
  document. If you submit your work in a format that is unreadable (bad file,
  .pages, html link, etc.), your work will be given a 0. If we can’t read it, we
  can’t – and won’t - grade it. The same goes for anyone who uses Google Docs.
  If it does funny things to the document format and alters the assignment or
  makes it unreadable, the assignment may lose points or not be graded. YOU are
  responsible for making sure your work is submitted properly and
  legible/readable.
</p>
<p>
  You will need Microsoft Word in order to complete the assignments for this
  class. As a Penn State student, you receive free access to Office 365 online.
  Every single student gets use of the Microsoft Office platforms using this
  app; therefore, no excuses of “But I don’t have Word.” or “But I use a Mac.”
  will be accepted for why your work is not in the proper format. If we cannot
  read it, we cannot grade it.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to keep up with case notes assignments throughout the semester
  - you will need this information to be complete and accurate to do the
  assignments in modules 12-14.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Evidence Summary Assignment</h2>
<p>
  In module 12 you will aggregate the results of the case notes that you have
  taken throughout the semester. Your summary will go over each piece of
  evidence by discussing the analyses performed on them and the results of those
  tests.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Drawing Conclusions Assignment</h2>
<p>
  In module 13, you will use the summary from module 12. Using your critical
  thinking skills, you will draw conclusions about the evidence in this case. Is
  it probative? Can it be associated with other evidence or people from the
  crime scene? Is your assumption about the evidence supported by science?
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Timeline of Events (Reconstruction) Assignment</h2>
<p>
  In module 14, you will use the assignment completed in module 13 to
  reconstruct the timeline of events from the crime scene, as well as discuss
  some alternate theories of the case. Based on the conclusions you come to in
  module 13, your timeline may vary greatly from those of your fellow
  classmates. This is expected and acceptable, as long as your timeline is
  backed up by your scientific interpretation of the evidence.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Forensic Science Professional Profiles</h2>
<p>
  The majority of the textbook is dedicated to criminalistics, but there are
  many other sciences that can be included under the forensic science umbrella.
  There are ten forensic science specialties discussed throughout the course.
  Each of these will include short reading assignments, a possible online
  activity or lab, and a 5 question, 5 point quiz.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Forensic Science Career Assignment</h2>
<p>
  Part of exploring any profession is understanding what it takes to be a part
  of it. You will examine job postings for crime scene, crime lab, and forensic
  specialty work in order to explore what it takes to enter the forensic science
  field. This is also an opportunity to see how the courses you take and the
  skills you develop in the classroom are directly applicable to your career
  once you leave Penn State.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Forensic Science Education Assignment</h2>
<p>
  As you will see from the Career Assignment, the educational requirements for
  jobs in the forensic science field vary widely depending on the type of work
  you want to do. For the Education Assignment, you will examine different
  degree options in relation to the job postings you analyzed during the Career
  Assignment to explore the differences between these degrees and why certain
  degrees may be necessary for some jobs but not others.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Photography Assignments</h2>
<p>
  You will have five photography assignments throughout the semester. They will
  each cover different uses and necessities of photography throughout a case
  including the use of photography for crime scene investigation (CSI),
  documentation of victims and suspects, initial evidence examination,
  documentation of evidence analysis, and finally the use of these photos as
  evidence or documentation in the courtroom.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Each module has a 10 question, 10 point quiz that you will have 10 minutes to
  complete. The quizzes contain multiple choice and true/false questions. All
  material in the module - except for the professional profile - is fair game
  for the quiz.
</p>
<p>
  Quiz questions are randomly drawn from a question bank specific to the module
  in which you are taking the quiz. Each bank may have up to 50 questions. The
  questions are pulled from the textbook reading, Canvas page reading, articles
  and third party website information, videos, and online labs/activities. While
  the quiz is open book, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you take some notes to
  use on your quiz and exams as you complete each module. Students who try to do
  the reading and take the quiz simultaneously generally run out of time because
  there is not enough time to do both.
</p>
<p>
  Each professional profile has a 5 question, 5 point quiz that you will have 10
  minutes to complete. The quizzes contain multiple choice and true/false
  questions. These quiz questions will only be on the information in the
  professional profile - no other content from the module will be in the 5 point
  quiz.
</p>
<p>
  Quizzes are open book and open note - they are not open friend. Make sure your
  work is your own.
</p>
<p>
  All quizzes will be available on Canvas. Check the calendar and module pages
  for due dates.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Case Note Quiz</h2>
<p>
  The formatting of case notes in forensic science is guided by some very strict
  standards and guidelines. In the world of forensic science, case notes are
  considered a legal document, and if they are done incorrectly, they can get
  thrown out of court. You will be introduced to the basics of proper case notes
  documentation in this class. The format you are being asked to follow is a
  bare bones version of what anyone entering a law enforcement or forensics
  profession will encounter. This is also a good introduction to the handwritten
  version of case notes you will encounter in FRNSC 210 if you intend to pursue
  the forensic science major at Penn State.
</p>
<p>
  Every semester, students needlessly lose points on their case notes
  assignments because they refuse to follow the format (or simply ignore the
  directions). This quiz is designed to make sure you understand the format that
  is required for case notes - especially the date and time.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Exams</h2>
<p>
  You will have three exams, each worth 100 points. Exams have 100 multiple
  choice and true/false questions. The questions are drawn from the question
  banks used to make the module quizzes. It is likely you will see some of the
  same questions on your exam that you had on a previous quiz - these will be
  mixed in with new questions you have not seen before.
</p>
<p>
  You will have 1 hour (60 minutes) to complete each exam. While the exams are
  open book, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you take some notes to use on your
  exams as you complete each module. It is also HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you
  study for this exam the same as you would any other. If you are unfamiliar
  with the material, you will have trouble finishing the exam on time - there is
  not enough time to look up every single answer in your notes or on Canvas
  while taking the exam.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Extra Credit</h2>
<p>
  The instructor will have VoiceThread or Kaltura lectures throughout the
  modules for you to watch. A VoiceThread or Kaltura lecture is like a
  PowerPoint lecture - you watch the slides while I talk over them. However,
  these are NOT traditional lectures. They will vary in length and complexity
  depending on the subject matter being discussed and there is not a lecture for
  every module. These lectures are designed to help explain concepts and
  assignments that students have struggled with in the past. It is worth your
  while to watch them with your full attention - do not do other work, watch
  Netflix, or engage in other distractions. Lectures are considered testable
  material unless otherwise stated.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Class Discussion on Piazza</h2>
<p>
  There are no discussion boards or group projects required in this class. That
  being said, students in previous classes have expressed a desire for there to
  be some sort of voluntary discussion forum where they can post questions or
  discuss assignments with fellow students. I have set up Piazza so that you can
  do just that. These forums will be monitored, so do not use them to cheat.
  Pointing a student to the correct section of the textbook to find and answer
  is acceptable – telling them the answer is not. This is the ONLY place where
  students are authorized to “collaborate” within this course.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Late Submission Policy</h2>
<p>
  Late quizzes and exams will not be accepted without prior permission from the
  instructor.
</p>
<p>
  Very late work may be accepted on a case-by-case basis. Students with
  long-term or serious illnesses or experiencing catastrophic life events have
  been granted extensions in the past. Doctor's notes or other documentation may
  be required. Again, extensions are not guaranteed, and are granted on a
  case-by-case basis by the instructor.

<p>
  The primary aim of this course is to prepare students for entry into the
  undergraduate forensic science program and to enhance success in the 400 level
  forensic science courses. This course is designed to introduce students to
  several fundamental areas and provide the theory and knowledge essential for
  success in the ﬁeld. The associated skills and abilities for these practices
  will be developed in later courses required for the forensic science program.
</p>
<p>
  Presently, forensic science and criminalistics are primarily specialized;
  forensic biologists, forensic chemists, trace evidence examiners, latent print
  specialists, ﬁrearm and tool mark examiners, etc. While some criminalists may
  be cross-trained in other areas, the majority practice solely in a speciﬁc
  sub-discipline. Regardless of the specialty, all criminalists and forensic
  scientists will be exposed to and required to perform many of the same
  essential practices. All criminalists will record observations, in the ﬁeld
  and in the laboratory, as case notes. They will prepare sketches, take and
  record measurements, and photograph scenes and/or physical evidence.
  Microscopes are used in nearly every sub-discipline for the examination of
  physical evidence. Criminalists are expected to report and testify to their
  examinations, analyses, results, and conclusions.
</p>
<p>
  This course is designed to introduce students to these fundamental areas and
  provide the theory and knowledge essential for success in the ﬁeld. The
  associated skills and abilities for these practices will be developed in later
  courses. FRNSC 210 provides a ﬁrm foundation for all later courses; it is the
  cornerstone of your education and will serve you well as a criminalist. This
  knowledge cannot be forgotten upon completion of this course; it must be
  retained as it comprises the essential practices required of all criminalists
  and forensic scientists.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>On completion of FRNSC 210, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Describe Kirk’s philosophy of criminalistics and the importance of
    scientific philosophy in forensic science
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe accuracy, precision, uncertainty of measurement, and assessment of
    error
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe the terms and organizations: quality assurance; quality control;
    accreditation; proficiency testing; ASCLD; and ASCLD-LAB.
  </li>
  <li>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Algebraic Skills</h2>
<p>
  Algebraic skills will be primarily developed through work on ALEKS. ALEKS is a
  web-based tutorial system which provides students with ongoing skills based
  assessments and tracks progress. The midterm and final exams will also entail
  skills based problems.
</p>
<p>
  As necessary, lectures will be done via BlackBoard Collaborate. The midterm
  and final exams will administered via Canvas.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">ALEKS</h2>
<p>
  Essentially all of the skills based work will be conducted through ALEKS. The
  ALEKS system will do ongoing assessments of skills based problems and track
  student progress. ALEKS is a major component of the course and a typical
  college algebra student will need to plan on 5-8 hours of online work each
  week (60-90 hours for the course). Skills based points will be earned by
  measuring mastered objective milestones and skills based ALEKS quizzes.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Canvas</h2>
<p>
  The course management system is Canvas. Canvas will be used to deliver, the
  midterm exam and the final exam and associated practice/study exams.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">PIAZZA & BlackBoard Collaborate</h2>
<p>
  Participation in the course is gauged via a student's interaction on Piazza
  and live sessions. Students are expected to ask questions, pose problems and
  answer questions via the Piazza bulletin board.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Grading</h2>
<p>
  The total number of points for the course will be 600 points. Work completed
  in ALEKS, which builds skills, will be worth 230 points. Participation points
  for active participation on the Piazza bulletin board and BlackBoard Live
  sessions is worth 20 points. The last component of the course consists of two
  (2) proctored exams, a midterm exam (150 points) and a comprehensive final
  exam (200 points). The final grade will be determined by the sum of these four
  areas.
