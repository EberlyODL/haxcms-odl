      <link>/blog-posts/11-19-18</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <div>Are you searching for a creative, interactive, and engaging way to have
    students submit details about an
    assignment or project they’re working on? Would you like this information to
    be exported to a nicely
    formatted text document instantly? Look no further! H5P’s Documentation Tool
    allows you to create a
    project outline complete with instructions and assessment possibilities. In
    this video, I set up a simple
    demonstration that identifies some basic goals while also asking users to
    supply their insight as they traverse
    through each step. Specifically, we look over the general settings of the
    tool and work through building an
    example that will help users scaffold out a detailed steps-to-completion
    outline, create a plan of attack, and
    organize / assess individual goals and contributions. At the end, we'll
    review the different ways we can
    implement this newly created content into your website. Check it out!

  My name is Charles Lavera; I am a Multimedia Specialist / Web Developer with
  the Office of Digital Learning (ODL) at the Eberly College of Science at Penn
  State. Originally from the Pittsburgh area, I uphold a broad background in
  digital-media and web-development with a focus on Drupal-installations, web
  component architecture, interactive content (H5P), and open-source technology.
  <br />
  <br />
</div>
<div>
  You could say that I wear many hats, but I consider my flexibility to be my
  greatest asset as I am able to provide support in a number of areas when
  needed. My favorite part of working with the ODL team has been the opportunity
  to collaborate with faculty and staff to create engaging web-experiences that
  showcase innovation and modern web-advancements. From complete websites to
  custom course-applications, we have fun exploring the deepest recesses of our
  creativity while we build a better future.

  non-traditional path began at Penn State where he earned his BA in Political
  Science. From there, Michael joined a local venture capital group where he was
  involved with many different companies and handled everything from sales, to
  product development, to logistics and shipping. When one such company lost
  their only web developer, Michael was tapped to takeover the programming
  responsibilities and the rest is history. Michael was immediately hooked with
  web development and begin soaking up every piece of information the web could
  offer.
<br/>
</div>

          <![CDATA[ <div>
  I have always been obsessed with visuals. When I was a kid I would go through
  my mom’s magazines, find an image I loved, check with my mom to make sure she
  didn’t need the article on the back, then clip it out and safely tuck it away
  in a flat, waxed-cardboard box under my bed - only to find out years later
  that my mom secretly snuck in my room and downsized my collection to keep it
  under control.
  <br />
  <br />
</div>
<div>
  These days, I apply my passion for visual arts to graphic design and
  photography. I soak up inspiration all around me, and still tear out magazine
  ads and tuck them away for reference. I strive to visually present the facts
  and discipline of science with creativity, quality, technology and whenever
  possible… a bit of humor. I am always looking for new ways to approach
  courses, graphics, and content to successfully visually communicate concepts
  with an audience.
  <br />
  <br />
</div>
<div>
  If I’m not behind a computer screen, you can find me outside with a camera by
  my side or in mad scientist mode in my kitchen - while tripping over a hungry
  cattle dog vacuum.

<h2>Proctor Information</h2>
<p>
  You will need to secure a proctor in order to take exams in this course. A
  proctor will not automatically be assigned to you; rather, you must make the
  necessary contacts to secure a professional who will serve in this capacity.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Contact a person who meets the qualifications and ask him or her to proctor
    your exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    Student Services must approve your proctor before any exams can be taken.
    Please see instructions for <a href="https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/courses/proctored-exams">securing a suitable proctor</a>
. While many proctors
    will serve on a voluntary basis, you are responsible for paying any expenses
    incurred in retaining a proctor.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must submit your proctor for approval or schedule your exams at a
    testing center using our online proctored exam portal. You will need to
    enter your proctor's contact information and submit proctor verification
    documentation. Note: If your proctor has been previously approved by the
    World Campus during a prior course within two years, you do not need to
    obtain verification. World Campus retains proctor information on file for
    two years. To learn more about using the online portal, visit the World
    Campus website "<a href="https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/a-z-index/using-the-proctored-exam-portal">Using the Proctored Exam Portal</a>
."
  </li>
  <li>
    If your proctor does not meet the required specifications, Student Services
    will notify you within 5 to 7 business days.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are a graduating senior requesting a final exam, please see
    additional information about early deadlines for course completion and exam
    scheduling.
  </li>
  <li>
    Contact <a href="https://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/contacts-help">Student Services</a>
 if you cannot take a scheduled exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless you have received permission to take your exam at an alternative
    time, your proctor will only allow you to take the exam during dates
    specified in your course.
  </li>

          <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course combines Human Anatomy, which is the study of parts of the human
  body, with Human physiology, which is the study of how parts of the body work
  together to make the body function. It is an introductory course for
  non-science majors, and it is hoped that you will develop a basic
  understanding about the human body that you will find useful when dealing with
  your own or a family member’s injury or illness in the future.
</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>
  All students are expected to complete the weekly assignments on time. These
  will be available for at least one week so budget your time accordingly. You
  are not able to complete all of your work for a month at one time and be done.
  This course is paced so you can progress through at a reasonable speed.
</p>
<p>
  Each week there will be at least one lesson for you to study. Each lesson will
  have one quiz, one homework assignment, and textbook assignment (LearnSmart
  modules, Labs, etc.). Be aware that some weeks there may be more than one
  lesson, thus more than one quiz and homework/textbook assignments. Each of
  these have specific due dates listed on the folder in which you find them.
</p>
<p>
  You may complete the homework and textbook assignments early as they will be
  available from the start of the semester. However, each quiz has a definite
  shelf life. Quizzes are meant to activate on a Saturday and deactivate on the
  following Sunday. That means you have more than a week to complete it. At no
  other time will you be able to view or complete quizzes, it is impossible to
  open up the quiz for a single person. The only exception to this is an
  instance of the quiz being improperly configured. If I short the class on time
  due an incorrect setting I will open up the quiz for additional time and
  everyone will have an opportunity to then complete it. However, that has been
  a rare event (but if it happens, notify the instructor). Pay attention to due
  dates, each assignment has one listed with the folder for that week.
</p>
<p>
  The quizzes are set to overlap so you can manage your schedule if you happen
  to be away from a computer for an entire weekend. If you know that will happen
  then either get things out of the way very early or make it a point to finish
  the following weekend. Missing an assignment should never happen if you manage
  your time properly. You will be entirely responsible for your time and
  scheduling.
</p>
<p>
  The weekly quizzes will be timed so it will not be possible to look up the
  answers to these questions at your leisure. The expectation is that you will
  study the content, gain some level of mastery of the terminology and take the
  tests to see how well you know everything. You are not to have access to
  sources of information when you take these tests, they are not open book.
</p>
<p>
  The homework assignments may be completed ahead of schedule but not after the
  due date. Being late a day or two will result in a late penalty. Homework
  turned in after that will result in a zero. Homework assignments should not be
  copied from any other source, cited correctly or not. Many assignments will
  have you finding information from sources including the internet, however, a
  cut and paste job does not equal effort. Googling information is not
  considered an academic achievement.
</p>
<p>
  Everything you write is expected to be your own work, not something you find
  and copy from the internet. It's perfectly clear when students have
  plagiarized a paragraph from a web page. It only takes 30 minutes to find a
  few web sites about a topic and then write up a summary of what you find.
  Don't risk University sanctions and an F for a homework assignment that should
  take less than an hour. See the statement on academic integrity for further
  information.
</p>
<h2>Late Assignments / Technical Difficulites</h2>
<p>
  Since you have seven days in which to submit homework, and take a quiz, I will
  not accept illness or technical difficulties as an excuse to make up missed
  work. The only exception to this would be an extended hospitalization stay.
  All quizzes and homework message boards are available at the beginning of of
  the course. The due dates listed with each assignment are the last days that a
  quiz or homework assignment is available. To avoid missing deadlines, submit
  your work early and avoid waiting until the last evening at 11:55 pm to submit
  your homework or take a quiz. Your internet dropping out at the last possible
  minute to submit work is not a reasonable cause for being unable to complete
  work in a timely manner. Do not turn in work at the last possible minute. No
  scores will be dropped. Work cannot be turned in for a higher grade once a
  grade is assigned. There will be no opportunities to turn in extra work for
  extra credit. Be prepared to do the necessary work to reach your goals for a
  final grade.
</p>
<h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
<p>
  All course work will be submitted to your instructor through Canvas. To do
  this, you will need to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the Modules button in the menu bar at the left of this page</li>
  <li>Choose the folder for the week we are currently in</li>
  <li>Click on the homework assignment for the week</li>
  <li>Type your answer into the text box</li>
  <li>Click "submit assignment"</li>
  <li>
    At the appropriate time click on the quiz for that week and complete it
    within the time specified or it will automatically submit whether you are
    finished or not
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  The Grading Scale can be found in the Getting Started section of Canvas. All
  grades can be found in Canvas by going to the Grades button on the left hand
  side.
</p>
<p>
  Each lesson has a quiz that will vary in length between 10 and 20 points each.
  Some will be longer than others depending on the amount of material covered in
  a particular lesson.
</p>
<p>
  Each quiz question is worth 1 point out of the total. Every question is worth
  exactly the same as any other question; only the length of the quiz each week
  will vary. Do not think in terms of percentage points here, this will be a
  point system based on total points.
</p>
<p>
  Students will work on these assignments as an individual and will be
  responsible for completing them on time. Late assignments will have a
  deduction, assignments more than a couple of days late will not be accepted.
  Once we reach the end of the course it will not be possible to go back and
  complete work that is outdated by weeks or even months. Keep up on assignments
  to gain maximum points.
</p>
<p>
  Grades are based on a combination of quizzes where each question is worth one
  point and various homework assignments worth a handful of points. All students
  are expected to complete the weekly quizzes on time. These will be available
  for at least one week so budget your time accordingly. You are not able to
  take all your tests at one time and be done. This course is paced so you can
  progress through at a reasonable speed.Each homework assignment has a specific
  number of points associated with it.
</p>
<p>
  Any questions concerning a particular quiz or homework assignment must be
  resolved immediately. You cannot wait till the end of the semester to correct
  any problems. Due to time constraints, it will be impossible to review all
  assignments on the last day in the hope of finding one or two points to meet a
  grade cutoff. You should ask that all grading issues be resolved as they occur
  during the semester. No exams will be dropped; no extra credit will be
  accepted. It's impossible to evaluate hundreds of book reports or shoebox
  dioramas.
</p>
<h2>Deferred Grades</h2>
<p>
  Students who are unable to complete the course because of illness or emergency
  may be granted a deferred grade which will allow the student to complete the
  course within the first six weeks of the following semester.
</p>
<p>
  When a request for a deferred grade is supported by the instructor, the
  instructor indicates this approval by recording the deferred grade symbol (DF)
  for the student. The expiration date for the deferred grade is automatically
  recorded as the end of the sixth week of the next semester. Spring semester
  approvals expire during the fall semester unless the student enrolls during
  summer session. Therefore, course requirements must be completed and a grade
  must be submitted by the end of six weeks into the student’s next semester for
  which he or she is registered. Any deferred grade that is not replaced by the
  deadline will automatically become an F.
</p>
<p>
  Note that deferred grades are limited to those students who can verify and
  document a valid reason for not being able to complete the last few
  assignments, not for gaining extra time to complete missing work from earlier
  in the semester. Students are expected to have completed at least 75% of the
  course assignments to be eligible for a deferment. For more information see DF
  grade.

          <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  You are a biological being, as are the foods that you eat. We use products
  from other organisms to make many of the clothes that we wear, build our
  homes, provide medicines, and give beauty to our lives. Therefore, developing
  an appreciation and understanding of the biological world is important to
  living in this world and becoming a responsible steward of its resources. Who
  hasn't watched a bird and wondered what it would be like to be able to fly? To
  see the world from a different perspective? This course will provide an
  introduction to fundamental biological topics (including cells, energy
  transduction, genetics, evolution, organismal structure/function, ecology) for
  non-majors in biology-related fields.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
  By the time you complete this course, you should have learned about the
  following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The role of natural selection, which shapes organisms in response to their
    environment through differential reproduction.
  </li>
  <li>
    The mechanisms of inheritance, and how DNA encodes the genetic information
    for all living organisms.
  </li>
  <li>
    The chemical basis of life, the origin of life on Earth, the structure and
    function of the two basic types of cells, and how cells utilize energy.
  </li>
  <li>
    The fundamentals of plant biology, including plant structure, response, and
    reproduction.
  </li>
  <li>
    The basic organization of the animal body, with a focus on the digestive and
    reproductive systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    How organisms interact with each other and their environment, and how human
    activities have modified the environment for other organisms.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion Forums</h2>
<p>
  Throughout the 11 lessons in this course, you will be expected to participate
  in discussions on a weekly basis. There are 15 participation points available
  for each lesson, for a total of 165 points. The quality of your participation
  will determine how many points you earn. If you fully answer the questions
  posted, in an original post with no quotes or copy and paste, then you will
  earn 7 pts. If you make 2 substantial replies to your classmates’ posts, then
  you will earn 4 pts each (8 pts total) for a total of 7 + 8 = 15 pts for each
  weekly discussion forum. No late submissions accepted. If you run into any
  difficulties, please email me asap.
</p>
<h2>Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Throughout the 11 lessons in this course, you will be expected to participate
  in multiple choice quizzes on a weekly basis. These short quizzes are to help
  you understand and apply the material being learned that week. You have one
  chance to take each untimed quiz before the weekly deadline. Upon submission
  of your completed quiz, it will be automatically graded, at 10 pts for each
  quiz.
</p>
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>
  Students are expected to take exams at the scheduled times. You will have
  plenty of advance warning as to when the exams are to take place. Please see
  the calendar. Contact me if there is a problem. Only
  legitimate excuses shall warrant a makeup exam to be taken as soon as
  possible. Legitimate excuses can include, but are not limited to, illness,
  family emergencies, trips, get called into work. Sleeping through the alarm is
  NOT a legitimate excuse! Neither is ‘my car broke down’ (bring me your
  mechanic’s bill) or ‘my ISP wasn’t working’----the least you can do is be
  creative! Each open, multiple choice exam is worth 100 pts and automatically
  graded after submission. No proctors required---but Penn State’s Academic
  Integrity policy is in effect. Upon submission of each exam, you are agreeing
  to abide by Penn State’s Academic Integrity policy.

          <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  An exploration of how cellular structures and processes contribute to life and
  how life displays unity even in its diversity. Students who have passed BIOL
  027, 110, or 141 may not schedule this course.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this course, a successful student will be able to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Understand basic chemical processes that take place in living organisms,
    including organic compounds and the basic macromolecules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify cell organelles and describe their functions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand basic energy concepts and how enzymes and membranes function.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand cellular respiration and photosynthesis and how they relate to
    each other.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the cell cycle, mitosis, and meiosis and how they differ.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand basic genetics (inheritance, Mendel’s Laws, DNA structure and
    function, gene regulation, DNA technology).
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand basic population genetics and evolution (natural selection,
    genetic variation, gene pools).
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the classification of organisms, taxonomy, and phylogenetics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand how the biological diversity on Earth originated and survey the
    major groups of organisms (prokaryotes, protists, fungi, plants, animals).
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe some of the issues in medical ethics that have arisen as a result
    of human tissue culture.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>
  You will be expected to check in every day or every other day for any
  announcements or updates. The amount of time spent looking over the material
  typically is correlated with quiz and exam grade: the more time spent studying
  usually translates into a better grade. Although this is an online course, you
  should expect to spend a similar amount of time on the material that you would
  for an in-person class. The general rule for studying is as follows: for every
  one hour of lecture, you should spend 2.5 to 3 hours studying the material.
  That means for a three-credit course, you should spend 7.5 to 9 hours per week
  studying and completing assignments if you intend to do well (“A” or “B”
  level).
</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<h3>Weekly Quizzes</h3>
<p>
  Each week a short quiz (about 15 minutes) will be made available on Canvas,
  covering the material from the previous week’s subject(s). Each quiz will be
  made available starting at 12:01 AM on Monday and will run through 11:59 PM on
  Wednesday. This is designed to ensure that you keep up with your reading and
  study. The quizzes will be in a true/false, matching, or multiple-choice type
  format and are intended to reinforce the main concepts in each chapter. These
  quizzes will only be open for a limited time, so do not go for extended
  periods of time (days, weeks) without having logged into the course. I
  typically do not re-open quizzes unless in the case of technical difficulties
  from my end. If you miss one or a few quizzes, this will not negatively affect
  your grade. If you have taken all 14 quizzes, only your 10 best scores will
  count towards your grade.
</p>
<h3>Book Discussions</h3>
<p>
  Each week, we will have discussions on Canvas about the book The Immortal Life
  of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot. These discussions will consist of one or
  more discussion questions posted by the instructor, which you will respond to
  and discuss. The first response will take place within three days of the
  initial discussion question post and will be at minimum 250 words (longer
  posts are welcome but will not necessarily improve your grade. Quality of post
  and not quantity will determine your score). After everyone has had a chance
  to make an initial response, you will make thoughtful comments on other
  students’ posts on the thread. These comments will be respectful (no name
  calling, threats, trolling, etc.) even if one does not agree with the post in
  question. The normal Penn State guidelines prohibiting harassment and hate
  speech will be in place and will be enforced. We can discuss controversial
  topics like adults because we are adults.
</p>
<h3>Midterm Exam</h3>
<p>
  Approximately every 4 weeks, you will have a midterm exam over the material
  covered. These exams will include true/false, multiple-choice, and/or matching
  questions; in addition there may be diagrams to label and/or short
  free-response questions. Exams will cover material for each “unit”: Exam 1
  will cover material from the beginning of the course until the first exam,
  Exam 2 will cover material after Exam 1 until the second exam, and so forth.
  These will be delivered online, but they will be proctored using Examiny
  software. You will have a window of about 72 hours to take your exam, but you
  must schedule it in advance through the Examiny tab in Canvas. If you make
  changes to your scheduled exam time less than 24 hours before the start of the
  exam window, Examiny will charge you a fee of $3.
</p>
<h3>Final Exam</h3>
<p>
  The final will be similar in format to the midterm exams. The only differences
  will be that the final will be slightly (about 50%) longer, and will be
  cumulative . The cumulative section will be about 33% of the final, and the
  remainder will be material covered after the third midterm. The final should
  be scheduled during Finals Week.

<p>
  The purpose of BI SC 003 is to help you prepare for living in the 21st century
  in a sustainable way. Through the course, you will come to realize that you
  are dependent upon and supported by natural systems, without which life on
  earth could not exist. By presenting ideas and concepts about living systems
  and their environment, it is hoped that an understanding of these biological
  and ecological principles and their application towards current environmental
  problems will give you the confidence to be a trustworthy instrument for
  healthy development, a conscientious steward of nature and an agent of change
  towards a sustainable society.

          <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course combines Genetics, Human Genetics, Evolution and Ecology. It is an
  introductory course for non-science majors, and it is hoped that you will
  develop a basic understanding of genetic and biological terms and their
  importance to our technologically advanced society. Evolution is a central
  theme of biology and it helps us to understand the process of life that is
  ongoing all across our globe. The interactions among members of that global
  community provide the backdrop for understanding the ecology of our planet and
  our place in that community. There are no prerequisites for this course.
</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>
  All students are expected to complete the weekly quizzes on time. These will
  be available for at least one week so budget your time accordingly. You are
  not able to take all of your tests at one time and be done. This course is
  paced so you can progress through at a reasonable speed.
</p>
<p>
  Each week there will be at least one lesson for you to study. Each lesson will
  have one quiz, one homework assignment, and textbook assignment (LearnSmart
  modules, Labs, etc.). Be aware that some weeks there may be more than one
  lesson, thus more than one quiz and homework/textbook assignments. Each of
  these have specific due dates listed on the folder in which you find them.
</p>
<p>
  You may complete the homework and textbook assignments early as they will be
  available from the start of the semester. However, each quiz has a definite
  shelf life. Quizzes are meant to activate on a Saturday and deactivate on the
  following Sunday. That means you have more than a week to complete it. At no
  other time will you be able to view or complete quizzes, it is impossible to
  open up the quiz for a single person. The only exception to this is an
  instance of the quiz being improperly configured. If I short the class on time
  due an incorrect setting I will open up the quiz for additional time and
  everyone will have an opportunity to then complete it. However, that has been
  a rare event (but if it happens, notify the instructor). Pay attention to due
  dates, each assignment has one listed with the folder for that week.
</p>
<p>
  The quizzes are set to overlap so you can manage your schedule if you happen
  to be away from a computer for an entire weekend. If you know that will happen
  then either get things out of the way very early or make it a point to finish
  the following weekend. Missing an assignment should never happen if you manage
  your time properly. You will be entirely responsible for your time and
  scheduling.
</p>
<p>
  The weekly quizzes will be timed so it will not be possible to look up the
  answers to these questions at your leisure. The expectation is that you will
  study the content, gain some level of mastery of the terminology and take the
  tests to see how well you know everything. You are not to have access to
  sources of information when you take these tests, they are not open book.
</p>
<p>
  The homework assignments may be completed ahead of schedule but not after the
  due date. Being late a day or two will result in a late penalty. Homework
  turned in after that will result in a zero. Homework assignments should not be
  copied from any other source, cited correctly or not. Many assignments will
  have you finding information from sources including the internet, however, a
  cut and paste job does not equal effort. Googling information is not
  considered an academic achievement.
</p>
<p>
  Everything you write is expected to be your own work, not something you find
  and copy from the internet. It's perfectly clear when students have
  plagiarized a paragraph from a web page. It only takes 30 minutes to find a
  few web sites about a topic and then write up a summary of what you find.
  Don't risk University sanctions and an F for a homework assignment that should
  take less than an hour. See the statement on academic integrity for further
  information.
</p>
<h2>Late Assignments / Technical Difficulites</h2>
<p>
  Since you have seven days in which to submit homework, and take a quiz, I will
  not accept illness or technical difficulties as an excuse to make up missed
  work. The only exception to this would be an extended hospitalization stay.
  All quizzes and homework message boards are available at the beginning of of
  the course. The due dates listed with each assignment are the last days that a
  quiz or homework assignment is available. To avoid missing deadlines, submit
  your work early and avoid waiting until the last evening at 11:55 pm to submit
  your homework or take a quiz. Your internet dropping out at the last possible
  minute to submit work is not a reasonable cause for being unable to complete
  work in a timely manner. Do not turn in work at the last possible minute. No
  scores will be dropped. Work cannot be turned in for a higher grade once a
  grade is assigned. There will be no opportunities to turn in extra work for
  extra credit. Be prepared to do the necessary work to reach your goals for a
  final grade.
</p>
<h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
<p>
  All course work will be submitted to your instructor through Canvas. To do
  this, you will need to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Click on the Modules button in the menu bar at the left of this page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose the folder for the week we are currently in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click on the homework assignment for the week.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type your answer into the text box
  </li>
  <li>
    Click "submit assignment"
  </li>
  <li>
    At the appropriate time click on the quiz for that week and complete it
    within the time specified or it will automatically submit whether you are
    finished or not.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  The Grading Scale can be found in the Getting Started section of Canvas. All
  grades can be found in Canvas by going to the Grades button on the left hand
  side.
</p>
<p>
  Each lesson has a quiz that will vary in length between 10 and 20 points each.
  Some will be longer than others depending on the amount of material covered in
  a particular lesson.
</p>
<p>
  Each quiz question is worth 1 point out of the total. Every question is worth
  exactly the same as any other question; only the length of the quiz each week
  will vary. Do not think in terms of percentage points here, this will be a
  point system based on total points.
</p>
<p>
  Students will work on these assignments as an individual and will be
  responsible for completing them on time. Late assignments will have a
  deduction, assignments more than a couple of days late will not be accepted.
  Once we reach the end of the course it will not be possible to go back and
  complete work that is outdated by weeks or even months. Keep up on assignments
  to gain maximum points.
</p>
<p>
  Grades are based on a combination of quizzes where each question is worth one
  point and various homework assignments worth a handful of points. All students
  are expected to complete the weekly quizzes on time. These will be available
  for at least one week so budget your time accordingly. You are not able to
  take all your tests at one time and be done. This course is paced so you can
  progress through at a reasonable speed.Each homework assignment has a specific
  number of points associated with it.
</p>
<p>
  Any questions concerning a particular quiz or homework assignment must be
  resolved immediately. You cannot wait till the end of the semester to correct
  any problems. Due to time constraints, it will be impossible to review all
  assignments on the last day in the hope of finding one or two points to meet a
  grade cutoff. You should ask that all grading issues be resolved as they occur
  during the semester. No exams will be dropped; no extra credit will be
  accepted. It's impossible to evaluate hundreds of book reports or shoebox
  dioramas.
</p>
<h2>Deferred Grades</h2>
<p>
  Students who are unable to complete the course because of illness or emergency
  may be granted a deferred grade which will allow the student to complete the
  course within the first six weeks of the following semester.
</p>
<p>
  When a request for a deferred grade is supported by the instructor, the
  instructor indicates this approval by recording the deferred grade symbol (DF)
  for the student. The expiration date for the deferred grade is automatically
  recorded as the end of the sixth week of the next semester. Spring semester
  approvals expire during the fall semester unless the student enrolls during
  summer session. Therefore, course requirements must be completed and a grade
  must be submitted by the end of six weeks into the student’s next semester for
  which he or she is registered. Any deferred grade that is not replaced by the
  deadline will automatically become an F.
</p>
<p>
  Note that deferred grades are limited to those students who can verify and
  document a valid reason for not being able to complete the last few
  assignments, not for gaining extra time to complete missing work from earlier
  in the semester. Students are expected to have completed at least 75% of the
  course assignments to be eligible for a deferment. For more information see DF
  grade.

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The possible existence of life beyond Earth is one of the most fundamental
  questions relating the human race to the physical Universe around us. While
  considerations of extraterrestrial life were in the domains of philosophy and
  science fiction in the past, today we have considerable scientific knowledge
  that can be applied to the question. Advances in modern astronomy have
  dramatically improved our understanding of our cosmic surroundings: tracing
  the cosmic origins of biological molecules, direct evidence for planets around
  most stars (exoplanets), and a deeper understanding of planet formation have
  all emerged in the past generation. Several fields -- geology, biochemistry,
  paleontology (fossils), evolutionary biology -- give insight (though not a
  complete understanding) on how life arose on Earth, and spacecraft travel
  provides constraints on life elsewhere in our Solar System.
</p>
<p>
  The results from studies on Earth, the Solar System, and exoplanets across the
  Galaxy together indicate that the conditions for life are widespread in the
  Universe; extraterrestrial life has not been found yet, but does not seem
  implausible. Interstellar space travel between habitable planets, by humans or
  other beings, is exceedingly difficult but not physically impossible. The
  course is thus rooted in modern science, but is connected to the long-standing
  philosophical question: Are we alone in the Universe? Today, this question is
  often embedded in science fiction (such as movies about aliens) and discussion
  about whether aliens have visited Earth. Today, astronomical studies are
  leading the way in answering part of the question: Earth-like planets seems to
  be extremely common. But there is no evidence yet for life outside of Earth.
</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>
  Part of the course resembles a traditional classroom learning environment: We
  have lectures by the instructor (online rather than in person), read chapters
  of our textbook, and take quizzes to evaluate that we have learned the
  material. But the course also has more (inter)active assignments: students
  participate in discussion forums; take part in a huge citizen science research
  effort; and engage in science writing, producing two papers. The result is a
  multifaceted learning experience, blending more passive knowledge acquisition
  with more active learning processes.
</p>
<h2>Outline</h2>
<p>
  The course is divided into five broad themes that are, in turn, divided into
  several topics. The course is designed as a 15-week course with a new Web page
  environment for each week. Readings from our textbook, {selected textbook for

<h2>Grading</h2>
<h3>Quizzes (48%)</h3>
<p>
  Four times during the semester after a Theme is completed, students will take
  a quiz on recent material covered in the class, associated reading and online
  material. The quizzes will last 40 minutes and have combinations of multiple
  choice, short answer and short essay questions. Students may have access to
  notes and the textbook, but study prior to the quiz is necessary because of
  the time constraint. Quizzes are taken in Penn State's ANGEL Web environment.
  Students can take the quiz anytime during specified 4-day periods from
  early-Friday to end-of-day Monday. Quizzes are `open book, open Web' format
  without proctoring; however, they are timed so that students are who are not
  familiar with the material cannot perform well. Each Quiz is worth 12% of the
  course grade.
</p>
<h3>Science Writing Papers (27%)</h3>
<p>
  Students will submit two original papers using topics and resources provided
  by (or in agreement with) the instructor. The goal is to learn techniques of
  science writing: the papers review scientific findings and will present them
  in a formal style. General guidence is given here, and the student and
  instructor interact individually on Paper #1. The student then writes Paper #2
  on their own; it is the same length as Paper #1 but is worth more points as
  the student can incorporate what they have leared about science writing. There
  are three deadlines: a draft of Paper 1, the final version of Paper 1 and, at
  the beginning of Exam Week, delivery of Paper 2. Details on science writing,
  paper requirements, and sample topics are given here. Paper #1 is worth 12% of
  the course grade, and Paper #2 is worth 15% of the course grade.
</p>
<h3>Discussion Forums (15%)</h3>
<p>
  Throughout the course, we will hold informal discussions on through PSU's
  ANGEL, and optionally VoiceThread, environment. The instructor will start with
  a question, sometimes accompanied with on-line material. Students then
  participate with independent or secondary commentaries. Points are earned by
  number and quality of contributions; contributions based on factual material
  is preferred over informal opinions. The maximum contribution is 15% of the
  course grade.
</p>
<h3>PlanetHunters Activity (10%)</h3>
<p>
  During Weeks 8-9, students will engage in the Zooniverse `citizen science'
  activity PlanetHunters. This involves a training session, classification of
  ~30 lightcurves from NASA's Kepler mission for possible planet transits, and
  completion of a worksheet and analysis. The goal is to examine observations
  from the Kepler observations of ~200,000 stars, characterizing the variability
  of the star and looking for periodic dips in brightness due to transiting
  planets.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the semester, course grades (A/A-/B+/B/B-/C+/C/D/F) will be
  calculated on a `curve' based on the instructor's judgment of class
  performance. Throughout the semester, each student can access their grades for
  past work on the ANGEL gradebook.
