  The university has posted their guidelines for Course Modes for Fall 2021.
  They are operating under the assumptions that:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>We will be able to be fully in person.</li>
  <li>
    Our rooms will operate at full capacity (without distancing restrictions).
  </li>
  <li>All students will be in residence.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  These guidelines are meant to assist changes based on intentional pedagogical
  decisions, and to highlight how faculty might place those changes within the
  context of all the courses they offer.
</p>
<p>
  This is a continually developing space and the University is working on FAQs
  which will be distributed as they are completed.
</p>
<p>
  The Office of Digital Learning, the Center for Excellence in Science
  Education, and the Office of the Sr. Associate Dean for Instruction &
  Curricula are here to work with faculty, share and review what we've done and
  learned, and support planning for and delivery of courses.
</p>
<p>
  We all share the goal of student learning. Additional information will be
  shared as it is created via College channels or
  <a href="https://keepteaching.psu.edu/" target="_blank">KeepTeaching</a>. If
  any faculty need assistance with planning for fall, they should contact any of
  our offices.
