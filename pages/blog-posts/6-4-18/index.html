  We were approached by John Waters from the Biology department with an
  interesting request. He told us he had a

  human head that he wanted to turn into a 3D digital model, if possible. He
  then had one of his TA’s bring the head over and we all observed it with
  morbid fascination…

  Yes, that is an actual human head, preserved by way of an exhaustive process
  involving an acetone and polymer bath. This particular model costs around
  $22,000. We were lucky to be able to observe it up close, but John’s problem
  lies in the fact that the classes in which he uses this model can consist of a
  few hundred students and it is difficult for everyone to get a good close-up
  look at the model. With its hefty price tag, he would rather not move it
  around very much to risk any damage or unnecessary depreciation. So he thought
  it might be easier to make a digital version of the head available to his
  students. Not just photos or video, mind you, but a 3D model that could be
  manipulated to see all of the detail and intricacy.

  Now, modeling this by hand would take months, if not years, to capture all of
  that detail. So we used a technique called photogrammetry to build the model.
  We took a series of high quality photos of the head, about 150, and then
  plugged it into a program that created a 3D model from the photos. What would
  have taken me months to model, was done in just a few hours:

  The software is able to add the color in the right places on the model as
  well. I am currently working on capturing even more detail with some new ways
  of photographing the model.

  Photogrammetry is a great technique to use in modeling organic pieces. For
  other items, like say, a knife, a pair of glasses, or a gun, the usual
  modeling process is the best way to capture the symmetry of these things. Take
  a look at this cleaver I made for the Forensics department:

  As you can see, there isn’t nearly as much detail as there is in the head so
  photogrammetry would be overkill for a model like this. However, there is
  still a process in modeling simple objects. The image above is just the model
  with no textures or color. Below is the model with textures and shaders with a
  background:

  There’s no doubt that modern photography can capture some amazing detail. But
  one can’t grab the object in the photo, examine it, and move it around.

  So what can 3D modeling do for you? Well, as I described above, it can provide
  a proxy for expensive or fragile items. It can allow for students to examine
  things that might normally require some kind of tedious setup or process. This
  will save you and your department time and money.
