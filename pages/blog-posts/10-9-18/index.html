  <li>
    Action & Expression (the HOW of learning)
  </li>
</div>
<div>
  <br />

</div>
<div>

  </li>

  <li>
    Build (to develop effort, language, symbols, expression and communication)
  </li>

  <li>
    Internalize (to develop self-management, comprehension and executive
    function)
  </li>
</div>
<div>
  <br />
  What is the ultimate goal of UDL?
</div>
<div>
