  Recently, our office was approached by

  to create a custom instructional element for his online course. Louis is an
  Associate Teaching Professor and Director of Online Education in Physics here
  at Eberly College of Science. Specifically, he was looking to create an
  attention-grabbing notification that he could easily insert throughout his
  course that would alert his students to relevant textbook information they
  should be reading.

  The overall process was very simple. Louis had an idea, emailed our team with
  the details, and we got to work. I used the specifications that Louis
  requested to rapidly develop a prototype for his review. Once approved, we
  inserted the new learning tool into his

  powered course and Louis was able to begin using it immediately by copy /
  pasting the following code into his editor:

  In addition to the default example shown above, I also added functionality to
  include additional icons that dynamically change the accent color (stop-icon =
  red, warning-icon = yellow, confirm-icon = green). Moreover, there is a
  'title' property and 'url' property that allow for further customization.
  Finally, the span slot is a flexible area in which any message can be written:
  <br />
  <br />
  <code-sample>
    <template preserve-content="preserve-content">
      <span slot="message"></span>
    </template>
  </code-sample>

  Why is this important? We work with some of the most talented faculty in the
  country and they have some really great ideas to share. By building these
  solutions out for them, we are enabling their creativity, empowering their
  instruction, and vastly improving the online course experience for their
  students.
