  Are you a faculty member looking to enrich your learning environment? Are you
  involved with long-distance learning or hoping to extend the reach of your
  content online? Kaltura might be the solution you are searching for. As some
  of you may have heard, Penn State recently purchased the Kaltura service.
  Kaltura is a new media management platform that allows users to easily store,
  manage, and share their media content in one central location. As one of the
  college’s liaisons for this upcoming transition, we wanted to let you know
  some important details moving forward.

  First, you can expect this service to begin the week of August 20th. At this
  point, you will be able to access Kaltura to start uploading media content and
  exploring relevant features. Currently, there are a number of ways to upload
  your content to Kaltura including Canvas (My Media), Kaltura capture, Zoom
  integration through the cloud, and psu.mediaspace.kalutra.com.

  For those using Adobe Connect to serve their media content, you should know
  that Adobe Connect will only be available through the Fall semester. After the
  Fall semester concludes, Adobe Connect will be set to ‘read only’ allowing
  users to access and see their content, but restricting new uploads and/or
  downloads. In May 2019, Adobe Connect will be shut down completely, so all
  necessary content migration should be completed by then.

  Moving forward our team will be in direct contact with the Kaltura
  implementation team to address concerns and relay faculty feedback. We
  encourage everyone to start exploring Kaltura. We also suggest hitting up
