  This past weekend (February 1-3) the Office of Digital Learning (Eberly
  College of Science at Penn State) participated in the eighth consecutive
  <a href="https://www.drupalcampnj.org/" target="_blank">Drupal Camp NJ</a>



, hosted at Princeton University. The annual event brings
  developers and industry professionals from varying backgrounds and
  skill-levels together to share all things <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>


 through engaging
  presentations, co-working sessions, and networking.
</p>
<p>
  This year there were a number of great discussions to get involved with, but
  one topic continued to dominate the conversation - decoupling Drupal.
  Decoupling Drupal essentially means separating Drupal’s front-end (theme
  layer) from it’s back-end (data/content layer) using a custom JavaScript
  framework. While there are still some discussions as to which framework is
  ‘best’ when decoupling Drupal, the general consensus is that the decoupled
  method is becoming an industry-wide movement.
</p>
<p>
  Jesus Manuel Olivas (Head of Products at <a href="https://weknowinc.com/" target="_blank">weKnow</a>

) showcased decoupling tools
  like <a href="http://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>
 and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/tome" target="_blank">Tome</a>
. These tools assist in creating static sites by
  decoupling Drupal’s theme and just using Drupal for content creation.

  Saurabh Chugh and Surendra Singh hosted a discussion, ‘Decoupling Patterns,
  Services and creating an enterprise level editorial experience’ where they
  also emphasized using decoupled applications to display content.

  Our team demonstrated decoupled development when Michal Potter and Charles
  Lavera joined ELMS:LN lead developer, Bryan Ollendyke (College of Arts and
  Architecture - Penn State) to present work on web components. Specifically,
  the trio discussed the tooling they use to quickly generate and publish their
  components onto the web (<a href="https://github.com/elmsln/wcfactory" target="_blank">WCFactory</a>
 / Drupal <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/webcomponents" target="_blank">webcomponents module</a>
). In
  addition, Bryan explored the future of content-authoring with a completely
  headless authoring experience called HAX.
