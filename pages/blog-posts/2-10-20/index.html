  Recently, the Office of Digital Learning (Eberly College of Science at Penn
  State) participated in the ninth consecutive
  <a href="https://www.drupalcampnj.org/" target="_blank">Drupal Camp NJ</a>
  , hosted at Princeton University. The weekend witnessed developers and
  industry professionals collaborating on a number of Drupal initiatives through
  informative presentations, networking opportunities, and engaging training
  sessions.

<p>
  Demonstrating their progress since Drupal Camp NJ 2019, the ODL team continued
  where they left off with their discussion on decoupling Drupal. Specifically,
  Michal Potter and I joined
  <a href="https://www.elmsln.org/" target="_blank">ELMS:LN</a> lead developer,
  Bryan Ollendyke (College of Arts and Architecture - Penn State) and Rebecca
  Goodman (Branch Chief, Web at U.S.
  <a href="https://www.archives.gov/" target="_blank"
    >National Archives and Records Administration</a
  >
  / NARA) to present work on web components.
</p>
<p>
  Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create custom,
  reusable, HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Because theyâ€™re built
  using web standards, they will work across all modern browsers and within any
  JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML. The team has been
  actively working to implement web components across a number of projects,
  including a custom suite of authoring tools (<a

    >HAX</a
  >
  ), Drupal, WordPress, Grav CMS and more.
</p>
<p>
  Bryan Ollendyke jump-started the conversation with a great introduction and
  Michael Potter and I showcased our implementation of web components across
  several custom web themes. The highlight of the talk was Rebecca Goodman
  announcing that her web team at NARA had started implementing web components
  into their work-flow by successfully placing a branding bar across several of
  their existing web properties.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, feedback was extremely positive. The audience contained a wide
  variety of technical backgrounds. Developers quickly understood how they could
  reduce technical debt across their projects, graphic designers saw how their
  interactions with Content Management Systems could be simplified, and project
  managers realized how this approach could reduce timelines of maintenance and
  enhancement across the board.
