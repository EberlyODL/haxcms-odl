<div>Are you searching for a creative, interactive, and engaging way to have students submit details about an
assignment or project they’re working on?  Would you like this information to be exported to a nicely
formatted text document instantly?  Look no further!  H5P’s Documentation Tool allows you to create a
project outline complete with instructions and assessment possibilities.  In this video, I set up a simple
demonstration that identifies some basic goals while also asking users to supply their insight as they traverse
through each step.  Specifically, we look over the general settings of the tool and work through building an
example that will help users scaffold out a detailed steps-to-completion outline, create a plan of attack, and
organize / assess individual goals and contributions.  At the end, we'll review the different ways we can
implement this newly created content into your website. Check it out!</div>
