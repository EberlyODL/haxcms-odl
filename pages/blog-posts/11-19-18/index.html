  <p>Are you searching for a creative, interactive, and engaging way to have students submit details about an
    assignment or project they’re working on?&nbsp; Would you like this information to be exported to a nicely
    formatted text document instantly?&nbsp; Look no further!&nbsp; H5P’s Documentation Tool allows you to create a
    project outline complete with instructions and assessment possibilities.&nbsp; In this video, I set up a simple
    demonstration that identifies some basic goals while also asking users to supply their insight as they traverse
    through each step.&nbsp; Specifically, we look over the general settings of the tool and work through building an
    example that will help users scaffold out a detailed steps-to-completion outline, create a plan of attack, and
    organize / assess individual goals and contributions.&nbsp; At the end, we'll review the different ways we can
    implement this newly created content into your website.&nbsp; Check it out!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
