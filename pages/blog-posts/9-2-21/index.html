  Over the summer, our office laid the ground work to begin implementing VR
  into our online course spaces. Specifically, we began development of a
  3D model-player that we could place inline with our course content.
</p>
<p>
  Our model-player leverages Google technology to render 3D models on the web,
  and
  it's supported by all modern browsers and devices. Current Features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Option to include multiple 3D Assets
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to insert detailed descriptions and images
  </li>
  <li>
    Possibility to play animations
  </li>
  <li>
    Choice to offer assessment opportunities
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Join me in the video below and I'll take you through a quick preview of the
  model-player illustrating some firearm models our team has been creating for
  Forensic Science. Keep in mind that we're still finalzing development, so
  this intended only as a preview and is not the finished product.

  Future plans include loading model-player up with models from all
  over the educational landscape. If you see the opportunity for VR
  in your science course, please email us; we'd love to set up a consultation!
