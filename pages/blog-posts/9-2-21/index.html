  Virtual Reality (VR) is creating new opportunities to engage students with
  immersive content every day. The increased availability, newer technology,
  and lower costs have reduced the barrier to entry for many resulting in a
  rapidly growing community using the platform for its learning and
  socializing capabilities.

  Over the summer, our office laid the ground work to begin implementing webVR
  into our online course spaces. WebVR is an open specification that makes it possible to experience VR on your browser or device.

  Our model-player leverages <a href="https://modelviewer.dev/" target="_blank">Google web VR technology</a> to render 3D models on modern browsers and devices. Current Features:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Option to include multiple 3D Assets
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to insert detailed descriptions and images
  </li>

  Join me in the video below and I'll take you through a quick preview of the
  model-player illustrating some firearm models our team has been creating for
  Forensic Science. Keep in mind that we're still finalzing development, so
  this is intended only as a preview and does not represent the finished product.

  Future plans include loading model-player up with models from all
  over the educational landscape. If you see the opportunity for VR
  in your science course, please contact us; we'd love to set up a consultation!
