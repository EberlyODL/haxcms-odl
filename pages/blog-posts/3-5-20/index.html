  The 2020 Horizon Report has just been released, taking a look at what may be
  impacting teaching and learning in the future. This report is very important
  in the digital world as it helps stakeholders learn, plan, and act on
  initiatives or developments that may influence higher education. The report
  summarizes trends that are unfolding as we speak: Social, Technological,
  Economic, Higher Education, and Political. Additionally, it takes a look at
  emerging technologies and practices that will have significant impact on the
  future of postsecondary education.

  The Office of Digital Learning is familiar with many of these emerging
  technologies, including NGDLEs, AI, Analytics, and online education. We hope
  you have a moment or two to download and look at the report. As always, we are
  interested in your thoughts and ways you think we can have an impact on the
  future of higher education.
