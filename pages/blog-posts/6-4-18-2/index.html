  Recently (May 24th - 25th), Michael Potter and I had the opportunity to
  present at the

    >Tech Pros Conference</a
  >
  at Penn State Dickinson Law. For those unfamiliar, Tech Pros is a conference
  that visits a different Commonwealth Campus each year to increase development
  and networking opportunities for IT professionals at the university. In past
  years, the conference has mainly focused on classroom technology, media
  integration, and technical support strategies. This year, the conference
  introduced a new track for the web, so we jumped on the opportunity to
  demonstrate some of the work we have been doing in Virtual Reality (VR).

  As some of you might remember, the Office of Digital Learning has been working
  with the Forensics team to develop an interactive crime scene prototype
  (https://odl.science.psu.edu/blog/post/3dvr-prototype). Specifically, weâ€™ve
  been using an open source web platform called
  <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://aframe.io/" target="_blank"
    >A-Frame</a
  >
  to deliver images overlaid with clickable hotspots. Once clicked, the hotspots
  reveal dialog windows that expose users to 3D models and other significant
  information. In addition, we have also been using similar techniques to
  implement 360 videos; check out this 360 video walk through of a cottage that
  Forensics students explore during mock investigations:
