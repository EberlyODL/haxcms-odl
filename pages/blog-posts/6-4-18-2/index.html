  Recently (May 24th - 25th), Michael Potter and I had the opportunity to
  present at the

    >Tech Pros Conference</a
  >
  at Penn State Dickinson Law. For those unfamiliar, Tech Pros is a conference
  that visits a different Commonwealth Campus each year to increase development
  and networking opportunities for IT professionals at the university. In past
  years, the conference has mainly focused on classroom technology, media
  integration, and technical support strategies. This year, the conference
  introduced a new track for the web, so we jumped on the opportunity to
  demonstrate some of the work we have been doing in Virtual Reality (VR).

  As some of you might remember, the Office of Digital Learning has been working
  with the Forensics team to develop an interactive crime scene prototype
  (https://odl.science.psu.edu/blog/post/3dvr-prototype). Specifically, weâ€™ve
  been using an open source web platform called
  <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://aframe.io/" target="_blank"
    >A-Frame</a
  >
  to deliver images overlaid with clickable hotspots. Once clicked, the hotspots
  reveal dialog windows that expose users to 3D models and other significant
  information. In addition, we have also been using similar techniques to
  implement 360 videos; check out this 360 video walk through of a cottage that
  Forensics students explore during mock investigations:

  During our presentation, Michael and I highlighted some of the more important
  aspects of working with A-Frame as well as some of the key technologies that
  we used to power the Forensics prototype. In addition, we showcased a variety
  of demos and also introduced Augmented Reality (AR) by superimposing a
  computer-generated 3D skull onto a

  Overall, we had a great time. The Tech Pros conference was rich with energy
  and excitement over emerging technologies, and everyone seemed eager to
  collaborate and share their ideas with each other. In addition to presenting,
  we had the opportunity to sit-in on some great panel-discussions as well as
  the chance to network with a number of colleagues within the university. We
  thank the Tech Pros organizers for having us and we look forward to sharing
  more advancements in web technology in the future.
