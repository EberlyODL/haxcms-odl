<p>
  With recent restrictions creating the demand for more engaging video content,
  our office set out to to create our own home-office / mobile lightboard. Making
  lightboards at home isn't something new. In fact, people have been creating
  their own lightboards for awhile and there are some really great resources out
  there to get you started.
</p>
<p>
  For the purposes of this project, I wanted to see if I could build our team
  lightboard using one of those resources while adding additional documentation
  and comparing costs for materials. In this example, I use Steve Griffith's
  article,
  <a
    href="https://flippedlearning.org/how_to/how-to-make-a-lightboard-for-less-than-100/"
    target="_blank"
    >'How to Make a Lightboard for less than $100'</a
  >. The article was written in 2016, and is featured on Flip Learning's
  website. Can we still do this for less than $100 in 2021? Let's find out!
</p>
<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>
  Before starting the project, I spent some time considering the overall size. I
  wanted something large enough to capture the talent and information being
  shared, but small enough it would easily fit inside most home-offices and
  vehicles for transportation; I decided on a 4' wide x 3' design.
</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    4 pine boards for the frame (I used 4' long, 1' 3/4" wide, 3/4" thick
    planks) It's important to pay attention to the overall thickness because
    we'll use a router to carve out a 1/2" channel for the recessed lights to
    sit in later.
  </li>
  <li>
    2 short pine 2x4's for the base (I used 3 1/2' long boards)
  </li>
  <li>
    3M ultra clear frame glass (cut to size)
  </li>
  <li>
    LED Light Strip (I used 16ft and trimmed off the access on the LED trimline)
  </li>
  <li>
    Wood Screws / Glue
  </li>
  <li>
    2 Shelf brackets
  </li>
  <li>6 coach screws, washers, nuts (to attach frame to base)</li>
  <li>
    6 short screws (to attach shelf brackets to the frame) Don't go too long in
    length on this screw or it will come through the otherside of the frame
  </li>
  <li>1 pack of Neon Dry-Erase Markers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>
  Making sure to be center, use a router or bench saw to cut a 1/2" wide x 1/2"
  deep recessed channel down the inside edge of each of the 4 pine frame boards.
</p>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>
  Mitre, mark, and cut the four corners to create the lightboard frame. You can
  also use this opportunity to drill a hole in one side of the frame so that the
  electical chord from the LED light strip can pass through; I kept mine towards
  the bottom.

  ></media-image>
</div>
<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>
  Using your two short pines (for the base), trim off 5" from the end of each
  board. Attach those trimmed blocks to the remaining board to create a support
  for your lightboard frame to rest against.
</p>

<h2>Step 4</h2>
<p>
  Using the wood glue and wood screws, begin to assemble the frame. Also begin
  attaching the bracket shelves and frame to the base using the coach screws,
  washers, and nuts. Important Note: Leave one end of your frame unglued so you
  can remove it later and slide in the glass.

</div>
<h2>Step 5</h2>
<p>
  Once you're certain everything is fitting together well, remove the frame from
  the base and paint; I used flat-black spray paint.
</p>
<h2>Step 6</h2>
<p>
  Once everything is dry, it's time to insert your LED light strip. Carefully
  press your LED light strip into the recessed channel of your lightboard. If
  your LED light strip is too long, you will need to trim it to fit. Important
  Note: If you need to trim your LED light strip, be sure to trim ONLY on the
  LED strip trim-line or you may break the LED strip; refer to your specific
  light product's instructions.

<h2>Step 7</h2>
<p>
  If you've made it this far, it's time to order the glass. I took the frame to
  my local custom-frame shop in Altoona, and they were able to measure and order
  a piece of 3M ultra clear glass to fit. It did take awhile, but once the glass
  came in, I brought it home and started the install.
</p>
<p>
  Using caution (the edges / corners of the glass are sharp), remove the secton
  of the frame that you left unglued in Step 4. Once removed, slowly and
  CAREFULLY, slide your glass down the recessed channel and into place. The
  glass will rest directly on the LED light strip; that's okay.

<h2>Step 8</h2>
<p>
  Once you have your glass installed and the frame is reattached, connect your
  lightboard to the base, tighten nuts, and plug it in for a test run.

<h2>Final Cost</h2>
<p>
  With our lightboard finished, it's time to add up our cost to see if we were
  able to come in under the $100 mark.
</p>
<li>
  4 pine boards for the frame: $20
</li>
<li>
  2 short pine 2x4's for the base: $7
</li>
<li>
  3M ultra clear frame glass (cut to size): $40
</li>
<li>
  LED Light Strip: $50
</li>
<li>
  2 Shelf brackets: $20
</li>
<li>
  Screws / washers / nuts: $10
</li>
<li>
  1 pack of Neon Dry-Erase Markers: $13
</li>
<li>
  Misc items I had around the house and didn't need to buy, but still cost money
  (paint, glue): $10
</li>
<li>
  <b>Total: $157</b>
</li>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>
  Unfortunately, I came in $57 over budget. I attribute this mostly to the fact
  that I built a slightly larger lightboard than the one used in the example
  article, and I also think the cost of some of these items has increased since
  the article was originally written in 2016. However, even over budget, this
  was still an extremely cost-effective solution for creating more engaging
  video content.
</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
  With your lightboard complete, it's time to start creating awesome videos.
  There are several important variables to consider when filming (studio setup,
  lighting, audio, backdrops, programs to edit your videos, etc.).

  does a great job providing some use-cases / examples. Beyond that, our office
  operates a full-size One-Button-Studio and would be happy to provide additional
