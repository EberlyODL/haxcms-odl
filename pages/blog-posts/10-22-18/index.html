  Web accessibility is an intricate part of the development process. As a
  builder, we need to ensure that our content is available to everyone,
  including the growing population of people with disabilities. If you’re just
  starting to explore web accessibility, this can seem overwhelming at first
  because there are a lot of factors that need to be considered. As a result, I
  wanted to put together a small list of tips that I found to be helpful when
  getting started.<br/>

  <b>1. Keyboard Accessibility</b>




  is one of the most significant areas to consider when building for the web.
  Many users who require accommodations for things like poor vision, tremors, or
  missing appendages rely on keyboard navigation to traverse through content.
  Lets take a look at a few tips that help achieve that standard.
  <br/>
  <br/>
</div>
<div>
  Using the tab and enter keys to navigate through your project, make sure the
  tab order is predictable and that you can quickly and clearly locate yourself.
  The active focus item will be identifiable by a styled border or outline that
  can be set in the code. Focus typically follows the flow of a page: left to
  right, top to bottom, header, main navigation, page navigation, and the
  footer. By default, users can only navigate to links, buttons, and form
  controls with a keyboard, other instances will require the use of tabindex="0"
  to ensure an element can receive focus. In general, it’s best to avoid long
  lists of links or navigation items that could make navigation difficult for
  keyboard-only users. Instead, consider providing a ‘skip to main content’
  link, using proper heading structure, or implementing WAI-ARIA functionality
  to assist users through the project.

</div>
<div>
  <b>2. Heading structure</b>




  in a project is essential for web accessibility. Heading elements in HTML are
  described as (h1, h2, h3, and so on). We use these elements to specify
  hierarchy within a document so that we can quickly scan and determine the
  overall information structure. Think about when you are confronted with a
  large document of information. It’s likely that you will quickly scan the
  information for large headings and/or bold text to help discover what you’re
  looking for. Screen readers and other assistive technology also have this
  ability when the appropriate heading structures are used.
  <br/>
  <br/>
</div>
<div>
  Review your heading structure. Be sure the project is not using using CSS
  (font-size / bold) to give the visual appearance of headings. Instead,
  implement a heading structure. For example, reserve level 1 headings (h1) for
  page titles or main content headings. Use level 2 headings (h2) to highlight
  major sections below level 1 headings (h1), and so on. The more organized your
  information structure is, the faster everyone will be able to find what
  they’re searching for.

  <b>3. The Web Accessibility Initiative’s Accessible Rich Internet Applications
    (WAI-ARIA)</b>




  specification is necessary for enhancing and supporting the accessibility of
  scripted and dynamic content. Specifically, ARIA can modify an existing
  element's language or add language to elements where no previous language
  existed, thus modifying the standard DOM accessibility tree. For example,
  imagine your page has a checkbox item:
  <br/>
  <br/>
</div>
<code-sample>  <template preserve-content="preserve-content">
<li tab-index="“0”" class="“checkbox”"></li>

</template>
</code-sample>
<div>
  <br/>
  While this appears fine for sighted users (class="checkbox" handles appearance
  correctly), a screen reader would miss that the element is meant to be a
  checkbox and a user with poor vision could end up missing the element all
  together. If we use ARIA attributes, we can call attention to the element and
  let the screen reader know how to interpret it. For example, let’s modify our
  checkbox example.
  <br/>
  <br/>
</div>
<code-sample>
  <template preserve-content="preserve-content"><li tabindex="0" class="checkbox" role="checkbox" checked="" aria-checked="true"></li></template>
</code-sample>
<div>
  <br/>
  Here you can see we've added the role ‘checkbox’ and aria-checked attributes
  to identify this element as a checkbox and to specify that it is checked by
  default. At this point, the element is now added to the DOM accessibility tree
  and a screen reader will correctly identify it as a checkbox. WAI-ARIA offers
  a number of accessibility specifications (too many to cover in this post). If
  you’re looking for more information, I would encourage you to visit:

  <b>4. Add ALT text to all images.</b>



  Is it as simple as it sounds? Yes, but oddly remains one of the most
  overlooked accessibility guidelines in place. If the user cannot view an image
  (slow connection, error, or if the user requires a screen reader), the alt
  attribute will supply alternative information for the image. Let’s pretend
  we’re inserting a smiley face icon and use the alt attribute:
  <br/>
  <br/>
</div>
<code-sample>
  <template preserve-content="preserve-content"><img src="smiley.png” alt=" smiley="" face”=""></template>
</code-sample>
<div>
  <br/>
  Now users who encounter errors and/or rely on screen readers will be able to
  see what that the image is portraying a 'smiley face', even if it wasn’t
  readily available to view.
  <br/>

  <b>5. Coordinate your colors.</b>


 Color contrast is extremely important on the
  web. Low vision and/or color blind users often find themselves unable to see
  the content presented to them because selected colors contrast poorly. In some
  cases, designs / color choices can be so subtle that they negatively impact
  screen readers. Thankfully, this issue can be mitigated by implementing the
  regular use of a contrast test. I have been using a plugin for Google Chrome
  called,
  <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh?hl=en-US" target="_blank">‘Wave’ - Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool</a>


. When used, WAVE will evaluate your web page for a number of accessibility
  options, including contrast. If there are contrast errors present, it will
  highlight them and provide recommendations for correct contrast.

  Accessibility is paramount to ensuring equal and fair access to content on the
  web. While it can be overwhelming to think about all at once, it’s necessary
  to be thorough in our implementation efforts. While the list above is far from
  comprehensive, it demonstrates a few key evaluations to consider when building
  projects. Moving beyond the tips above, I would encourage everyone to examine
  their project through the lense of someone requiring a special accommodation.
  Are you able to navigate easily? Are your heading structures in place? Do you
  know what an image portrays even though you can’t physically see it? These are
  all scenarios that will help you visualize and prioritize accessibility in
  your work. I would also suggest that you review your code for accessibility in
  phases (CSS, HTML, JS) - it’s easier to spot errors and make corrections in
  manageable chunks, rather than trying to review the whole project at once.
  Finally, I would advocate reaching out to / joining accessibility groups. For
  example, the
  <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://sites.psu.edu/accessibilityusers/" target="_blank">Accessibility Users Group at Penn State</a>



  offers monthly meetings, a wealth of great information on accessibility
  standards, and the opportunity to network with other colleagues exploring
  accessibility.
