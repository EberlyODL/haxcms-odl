<p>
  The possible existence of life beyond Earth is one of the most fundamental
  questions relating the human race to the physical Universe around us. While
  considerations of extraterrestrial life were in the domains of philosophy and
  science fiction in the past, today we have considerable scientific knowledge
  that can be applied to the question. Advances in modern astronomy have
  dramatically improved our understanding of our cosmic surroundings: tracing
  the cosmic origins of biological molecules, direct evidence for planets around
  most stars (exoplanets), and a deeper understanding of planet formation have
  all emerged in the past generation. Several fields -- geology, biochemistry,
  paleontology (fossils), evolutionary biology -- give insight (though not a
  complete understanding) on how life arose on Earth, and spacecraft travel
  provides constraints on life elsewhere in our Solar System.
</p>
<p>
  The results from studies on Earth, the Solar System, and exoplanets across the
  Galaxy together indicate that the conditions for life are widespread in the
  Universe; extraterrestrial life has not been found yet, but does not seem
  implausible. Interstellar space travel between habitable planets, by humans or
  other beings, is exceedingly difficult but not physically impossible. The
  course is thus rooted in modern science, but is connected to the long-standing
  philosophical question: Are we alone in the Universe? Today, this question is
  often embedded in science fiction (such as movies about aliens) and discussion
  about whether aliens have visited Earth. Today, astronomical studies are
  leading the way in answering part of the question: Earth-like planets seems to
  be extremely common. But there is no evidence yet for life outside of Earth.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Activities</h2>
<p>
  Part of the course resembles a traditional classroom learning environment: We
  have lectures by the instructor (online rather than in person), read chapters
  of our textbook, and take quizzes to evaluate that we have learned the
  material. But the course also has more (inter)active assignments: students
  participate in discussion forums; take part in a huge citizen science research
  effort; and engage in science writing, producing two papers. The result is a
  multifaceted learning experience, blending more passive knowledge acquisition
  with more active learning processes.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Outline</h2>
<p>
  The course is divided into five broad themes that are, in turn, divided into
  several topics. The course is designed as a 15-week course with a new Web page
  environment for each week. Readings from our textbook, {selected textbook for

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Grading</h2>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Quizzes (48%)</h3>
<p>
  Four times during the semester after a Theme is completed, students will take
  a quiz on recent material covered in the class, associated reading and online
  material. The quizzes will last 40 minutes and have combinations of multiple
  choice, short answer and short essay questions. Students may have access to
  notes and the textbook, but study prior to the quiz is necessary because of
  the time constraint. Quizzes are taken in Penn State's ANGEL Web environment.
  Students can take the quiz anytime during specified 4-day periods from
  early-Friday to end-of-day Monday. Quizzes are `open book, open Web' format
  without proctoring; however, they are timed so that students are who are not
  familiar with the material cannot perform well. Each Quiz is worth 12% of the
  course grade.
</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Science Writing Papers (27%)</h3>
<p>
  Students will submit two original papers using topics and resources provided
  by (or in agreement with) the instructor. The goal is to learn techniques of
  science writing: the papers review scientific findings and will present them
  in a formal style. General guidence is given here, and the student and
  instructor interact individually on Paper #1. The student then writes Paper #2
  on their own; it is the same length as Paper #1 but is worth more points as
  the student can incorporate what they have leared about science writing. There
  are three deadlines: a draft of Paper 1, the final version of Paper 1 and, at
  the beginning of Exam Week, delivery of Paper 2. Details on science writing,
  paper requirements, and sample topics are given here. Paper #1 is worth 12% of
  the course grade, and Paper #2 is worth 15% of the course grade.
</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Discussion Forums (15%)</h3>
<p>
  Throughout the course, we will hold informal discussions on through PSU's
  ANGEL, and optionally VoiceThread, environment. The instructor will start with
  a question, sometimes accompanied with on-line material. Students then
  participate with independent or secondary commentaries. Points are earned by
  number and quality of contributions; contributions based on factual material
  is preferred over informal opinions. The maximum contribution is 15% of the
  course grade.
</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">PlanetHunters Activity (10%)</h3>
<p>
  During Weeks 8-9, students will engage in the Zooniverse `citizen science'
  activity PlanetHunters. This involves a training session, classification of
  ~30 lightcurves from NASA's Kepler mission for possible planet transits, and
  completion of a worksheet and analysis. The goal is to examine observations
  from the Kepler observations of ~200,000 stars, characterizing the variability
  of the star and looking for periodic dips in brightness due to transiting
  planets.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the semester, course grades (A/A-/B+/B/B-/C+/C/D/F) will be
  calculated on a `curve' based on the instructor's judgment of class
  performance. Throughout the semester, each student can access their grades for
  past work on the ANGEL gradebook.
