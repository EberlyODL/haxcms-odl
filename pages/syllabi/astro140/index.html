<p>The possible existence of life beyond Earth is one of the most fundamental questions relating the human race to the physical Universe around us. While considerations of extraterrestrial life were in the domains of philosophy and science fiction in the past, today we have considerable scientific knowledge that can be applied to the question. Advances in modern astronomy have dramatically improved our understanding of our cosmic surroundings: tracing the cosmic origins of biological molecules, direct evidence for planets around most stars (exoplanets), and a deeper understanding of planet formation have all emerged in the past generation.  Several fields -- geology, biochemistry, paleontology (fossils), evolutionary biology --  give insight (though not a complete understanding) on how life arose on Earth, and spacecraft travel provides constraints on life elsewhere in our Solar System. </p>

<p>The results from studies on Earth, the Solar System, and exoplanets across the Galaxy together indicate that the conditions for life are widespread in the Universe; extraterrestrial life has not been found yet, but does not seem implausible. Interstellar space travel between habitable planets, by humans or other beings, is exceedingly difficult but not physically impossible.   The course is thus rooted in modern science, but is connected to the long-standing philosophical question: Are we alone in the Universe? Today, this question is often embedded in science fiction (such as movies about aliens) and discussion about whether aliens have visited Earth.  Today, astronomical studies are leading the way in answering part of the question:  Earth-like planets seems to be extremely common.  But there is no evidence yet for life outside of Earth.</p>
