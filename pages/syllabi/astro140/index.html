<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  The problem of the existence of life beyond Earth is investigated, drawing
  from recent research in astronomy and other fields. For
  non-science majors. Prerequisite: ASTRO 001, ASTRO 005, or ASTRO 010
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Credits and Prerequisites</h2>
<p>
  ASTRO 140 provides 3 credits at the undergraduate level and satisfies part of
  the University's General Education Natural Sciences (GN) requirement for a
  baccalaureate degree. The course is designed for non-science majors who have
  had a semester or more of science; it is not intended as the students’ first
  university-level science course. Many students have taken a general astronomy
  class (ASTRO 1, 5, 6, 7, or 10) but also students with classes in Earth
  sciences, biology, or chemistry are probably also adequately prepared. Please
  contact the instructor to discuss your background if you do not have the
  formal prerequisites.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Schedule</h2>
<p>
  There are no face-to-face classes for this World Campus course; it is on-line
  only. The class follows the University academic calendar. There
  is no Final Exam but there are assignments that must be completed by exam
  week.
  The curriculum is divided into 15 weeks with five themes (listed below).

</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Course Overview</h2>
<p>
  The possible existence of life beyond Earth is one of the most fundamental
  questions relating human beings to the physical Universe around us. While
  considerations of extraterrestrial life were in the domains of philosophy and
  science fiction in the past, today we have considerable scientific knowledge
  that can be applied to the question. Advances in modern astronomy have
  dramatically improved our understanding of our cosmic surroundings: most
  importantly we now know (in the past decade) that most stars we see at night
  have their own planetary systems, and some of appear to be habitable. Several
  fields -- geology, biochemistry, paleontology (fossils), evolutionary biology
  -- give insight (though not a complete understanding) on how life arose on
  Earth, and robotic spacecraft are actively searching for life elsewhere in our
  Solar System.
</p>
<p>
  The results from studies on Earth, the Solar System, and exoplanets across the
  Galaxy together indicate that the conditions for life are widespread in the
  Universe; extraterrestrial life has not been found yet, but does not seem
  implausible. Interstellar space travel between habitable planets, by humans or
  other advanced beings, is exceedingly difficult but not physically impossible.
  The course is thus rooted in modern science, but is connected to the
  long-standing philosophical question: Are we alone in the Universe? In the
  past, this question is often embedded in science fiction (such as movies about
  aliens) and discussion about whether aliens have visited Earth. Today,
  astronomical studies are leading the way in answering parts of the question
  with a strong scientific foundation. But there is no evidence yet for life
  outside of Earth.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Student Activiites and
  Responsibilities</h2>
<p>
  Part of the course resembles a traditional classroom learning environment: We
  have lectures by the instructor (online rather than in person except for
  introductory videos), read chapters of our textbook, and take quizzes to
  evaluate that we have learned the material. But the course also has more
  interactive assignments: students participate in focused discussion forums;
  take part in a huge citizen science research effort to find exoplanets; and
  engage in science writing. The result is a multifaceted learning experience
  encouraging students to engage in active learning processes. At Penn State,
  students are expected to devote around 9 hours-per-week to a 3-credit course
  during the 15-week semester. It is not a trivial commitment. Student
  responsibilities are distributed throughout the semester and the course cannot
  be completed in a rush.
</p>
<p>
  Having no face-to-face classes in a World Campus class has the disadvantage
  that we never meet as a learning community, much like all university classes
  during last year's Covid-19 pandemic. But distance learning also has
  advantages. Students need not reside or travel to the Penn State campus; they
  can live anywhere in the world. Students do not have to attend Astro 140
  classes at specific times; all interactions are asynchronous. This is very
  convenient for individuals with other important responsibilities. But the
  independence provided by World Campus does mean that students must be
  disciplined in devoting time to the course continuously during the semester.
  Duties include: studying course material (on-line lectures, linked on-line
  material, textbook reading), taking timed quizzes (which must be taken in the
  Canvas Web environment within specified 4-day intervals), writing short
  research papers (with specified deadlines), participating in interactive
  discussions, and engaging in an on-line Citizen Science activity. Details of
  the student responsibilities appear below under Graded Activities.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Course Outline</h2>
<p>
  The course is divided into five themes that are, in turn, divided into several
  topics. The course is designed as a 15-week course with a new Web page
  environment for each week. Readings from our textbook, An Introduction to
  Astrobiology (abbreviated AIA) associated with each week are listed. Note that
  Thanksgiving Holiday takes place between Weeks 13 and 14.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Graded Activities</h2>
<p>
  <strong>40% Quizzes</strong> After each Theme, students will take a quiz on
  recent material covered in the class, associated reading and online material.
  The quizzes have combinations of multiple choice, short answer and short essay
  questions. Students may have access to notes, the textbook, and the Web, but
  study prior to the quiz is necessary because of the time constraint. Each quiz
  will be taken in Penn State's Canvas Web environment in a single sitting
  anytime over a 4-day period starting early-Friday and ending end-of-Monday.
  Dates are: Quiz #1, Quiz #2, Quiz #3, Quiz #4, Quiz #5. For each student, the
  lowest scoring quiz is
  dropped and each remaining quizzes is worth 10% of the course grade.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>30% Papers</strong> Students will submit two original papers using
  topics and resources provided by the instructor. The goals are: (1)
  investigating a narrow scientific issue in some detail; (2) assimilating
  diverse information into a coherent narrative; and (3) training in the art of
  scientific writing. The papers review scientific findings and present them in
  a formal style. Papers have 3 pages single-spaced of text supplemented by
  references and figures. The student learns how to write high-quality
  scientific documents from background material benefiting from individual
  interaction with the instructor on Paper #1. The student then writes Paper #2
  on their own. There are three deadlines: preliminary draft of Paper 1 (outline
  + 2 paragraphs, 3% of grade), final version of Paper 1 (12%), and delivery of
  Paper 2 (15%). More details
  about science writing, paper requirements, and sample topics will be given in
  the course content website.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>20% Discussion</strong> Throughout the course, we will hold informal
  discussions on through the Canvas Discussion environment. The instructor will
  start with a question, often accompanied with on-line material. Students then
  participate with with commentary and interaction based on scientific fact and
  reasoning. Points are earned by number and quality of contributions with a
  maximum of 20% of the course grade.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>10% Project</strong> During Weeks 8-10, we will engage in the
  Zooniverse Citizens Science' activity <a
    href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nora-dot-eisner/planet-hunters-tess"
    target="_blank">Planet Hunters TESS</a> based on NASA’s
  Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite launched
  in 2018. After Web-guided training, each student will examine a different
  subset of TESS’s star ‘light curves’, looking for the characteristics repeated
  dips in brightness that occur when an exoplanet passes in front of the star.
  Students will submit a document of their effort and analysis, and the class’s
  collective contribution will be discussed.
