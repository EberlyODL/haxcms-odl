<p>
  Like Astro 001, this course has a central narrative, a story that we will
  follow as we cover different topics of cosmological interest. Our story has no
  relation to any you might have encountered in a previous webcourse. Here is a
  brief preview of our narrative context and setting: They say the future wasn't
  the one we wanted. But it was the one we deserved. The year is 2104. Kinsey
  Morales lives in a fractured world, one pummeled by a century of climate
  change, resource shortages, and political ineptitude. A history major at what
  once was Penn State, she marvels at the twentieth century's glossy, optimistic
  visions of the future, with alien contact and space travel and miraculous
  technologies catering to any conceivable whim. Her future has none of these
  things. How were they so wrong? Why is the Universe so wrong? Her search for
  answers brings Kinsey, a classmate, and two professors to the shadowy depths
  of Black Moshannon forest, the site of a secret, forgotten project. Their
  journey leads them through fabric of space and time, the depths of elusive
  black holes, and the grandest structures of the cosmic frontier. They travel
  to the beginning of space and to the end of time, from vibrant soup of
  creation, to the chilly plains of oblivion. In the end they learn that
  humanity's future is still in the cosmos. But not in a way anyone could have
  imagined.

  The semester divided into roughly 3-week periods for each of the five major
  units:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Life and Death in the Milky Way — The layout of the Milky Way Galaxy,
    distances within the Galaxy, the Fermi Paradox, the Galactic Habitable Zone
    1
  </li>
  <li>
    Warps in Space and Time — Properties of space and time, wormholes, time
    travel, relativity, black holes
  </li>
  <li>
    The Dance of Galaxies — Other galaxies, dark matter, galaxy environments,
    galaxy evolution, the distance ladder
  </li>
  <li>
    The Slow March of Time — dark energy, the fate of the universe, string
    theory, “Boltzmann brains”
  </li>
  <li>
    Beginnings and Ends — cosmic microwave background, big bang cosmology,
    multiverses, holography, “alternative” cosmologies
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  You may work through the online material at whatever pace suits you, but be
  aware that at the end of each 3-week period, there will be an exam covering
  that unit's material. Exams will have 50 questions each, in multiple choice
  format. The exam after Unit 5 will be a cumulative, final exam of the same
  format (i.e., 5 exams total).

  The course content for this course is accompanied by a wealth of images. The
  Astro 120 Web course layout is optimized for a web browser window with at
  least a 850 x 600 pixels display area. Features in the course—images, movies,
  activities, questions, etc.—will require a browser with Javascript and CSS
  Style Sheets enabled. The current version of Firefox (for Mac OS or for
  Windows) is recommended. Cookies, Java, and JavaScript must be enabled. Due to
  nonstandard handling of CSS, JavaScript, and caching, we do not recommend
  using Internet Explorer as your browser.
</p>
<p>
  You may need to turn off pop-up window blocking (some browsers distinguish
  between blocking all pop-up windows, and just "unwanted" pop-ups). If you find
  a link that says it would open a new window and it does not, please check your
  browser's settings.

  Many movies are in Quicktime '.mov' and Shockwave/Flash '.swf' format. Some
  are in Windows Media '.wmv' format. Apple's Quicktime can be found at

  Penn State's ITS computer labs meet the technology requirements for this
  course. See
  <a style="text-decoration: none; color:#e2801e;" href="http://clc.its.psu.edu/Labs/" target="_blank">http://clc.its.psu.edu/Labs/</a>
  for information on locations and hours of operation. Note: if you plan to
  access this course in a public computer lab, you might want to bring along a
  set of headphones.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Exams</h2>
<p>
  The course material is presented online.
</p>
<p>
  Each of the first four units of the course will have a 50-minute
  (non-proctored) exam devoted to its material. The 1-hour final exam will be a
  50 question cumulative final exam, including the content of Unit 5. This exam
  will be scheduled during the usual final exam period for the semester and will
  be delivered through Canvas.
</p>
<p>
  You may drop the lowest test score of the four unit exams. The cumulative
  final grade may not be dropped. Since one test may be dropped, there will be
  NO MAKEUP TESTS given except in the case of emergency. Emergencies must be
  documented by written proof.
</p>
<p>
  You must complete the relevant material before the exam period begins. You can
  do this at your own pace and convenience; however, do be sure to allow enough
  time. It is probably best to do a bit each week, as opposed to leaving
  everything for the last day before the test period. In total, we expect about
  the same amount of your time to be required as in a traditional class. You
  will see many multiple choice questions dispersed through the material and you
  must correctly answer these to progress. If you get them wrong you are usually
  given hints. You will be graded on the basis of completion of a unit or part
  of a unit, but not on answering the questions correctly on the first try.
</p>
<p>
  One week before each test we will post on Canvas some traditional style review
  notes and sample questions for the test. You should study these carefully. It
  is likely you will see this material and many of these questions on the exam.
  You will also receive a few email reminders before each test.
