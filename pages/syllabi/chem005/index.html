<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  CHEM 005 incorporates reading, problem-solving, and ‘edible’ home experiments
  to develop an understanding of chemical concepts and scientific inquiry within
  the context of food and cooking. Prior study of chemistry is not assumed, but
  you should have taken at least one class in algebra before taking CHEM 005.
  For some students, CHEM 005 provides the chemistry required by their major
  area of study. For other students, CHEM 005 provides review and preparation
  for subsequent Chemistry classes such as CHEM 110 (Chemical Principles I) and
  CHEM 130 (Introduction to General, Organic, and Biochemistry).
</p>

  Lab Reports (10 total, each worth 20 points): Most of the lessons will have a
  lab activity performed individually by the student. Each experiment will have
  a lab report submitted consisting of experimental data, observations (and
  pictures, when applicable), and short answers to interpretive questions. See
  course schedule for deadlines for each lab report. There will be 10 lab report
  total, each worth 20 points.
</p>
<h2>Course Discussions</h2>

<h2>Late Submission Policy</h2>
<p>
  Meeting assigned due dates is critical for demonstrating progress and ensuring
  appropriate time for instructor feedback on assignments. We recommend that you
  try to complete the assignments as close to the scheduled time as possible.
</p>
<p>
  However, sometimes students are unable to meet due dates. In those rare cases,
  the following late submission policy applies:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    There is a 3-day grace period on all due dates, except midterm exams,
    assignments for Lesson 12, and the final project. For example, the lab 1
    report is due at 11:59 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) Sunday September 2,
    however you'll still receive full credit if you submit the report by 11:59
    pm EST Wednesday September 5.
  </li>
  <li>
    With the exception of the midterm exams, assignments for Lesson 12, and the
    final project, you may submit assignments late up until the last day of the
    semester. Note that each Canvas assignment will automatically stop accepting
    submission after the 3-day grace period, so instructor approval is needed
    for late submissions. A penalty of ten percent (10%) per week will be
    applied to the grade you achieved on the assignment for each week the
    assignment is submitted after the deadline.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assignments will not be accepted after the last day of the semester unless a
    Deferred Grade has been approved by the instructor.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will grade late submitted assignments no later than a week after you
    submit the assignment. Be sure to notify me of the late submission and to
    ensure that I have received the assignment. The full ten percent (10%) late
    penalty for each week applies regardless of the day of the week you submit
    your work.
  </li>
  <li>
    I may accept late work for full credit in the case of extenuating
    circumstances (such as hospitalization, childbirth, major accident or injury
    and bereavement). You should notify me immediately of any extenuating
    circumstances that prevent you from submitting your work on time.
  </li>
</ul>
