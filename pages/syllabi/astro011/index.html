<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course focuses on experiments and explorations to illustrate major
  astronomical principles and techniques. Travel through a telescope to form
  observations of planets, stars and nebulae. Discover the universe through
  engaging discussions and weekly labs. Weekly labs include discussion of the
  search for extraterrestrial intelligence, an activity to illustrate the phases
  of the moon, analysis of the colorful spectra of different chemical elements,
  and exploration of the deepest image of space ever obtained. In addition,
  students will complete a semester nighttime observation project that typically
  involves learning some constellations, tracing phases of the moon, and
  sketching images seen through our well-equipped rooftop student observatory.
</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>ASTRO 001 OR ASTRO 010 (may be taken concurrently).</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
  By the end of this course, students should have gained sufficient knowledge
  to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Develop skills of recognizing and asking answerable research questions.
  </li>
  <li>Design and write clear step-by-step procedures.</li>
  <li>Systematically collect data.</li>
  <li>Perform and document analysis of those data.</li>
  <li>Construct and articulat arguments from evidence.</li>
  <li>Present data visually.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  To achieve these goals, we will use simple observations, software simulations,
  and online astronomical data sets and images to explore a number of
  astronomical phenomena.
</p>
<h2>Weekly Labs</h2>
<p>
  Weekly lab activities are designed to take approximately 2 hours per week. In
  addition, there are discussion board activities most weeks; these should take
  no more than 10 minutes per week.
</p>
<p>
  All weekly labs are designed to be done completely online, using materials on
  the class website as well as other supplementary websites (listed in the
  labs). The labs may be completed at any time during the week, but must be
  submitted by the deadline (normally at the end of each week). Participation
  activities normally consist of an original post (due midweek) and responses to
  your classmates posts (due by the end of the week).
</p>
<h2>Semester Project</h2>
<p>
  This project is to be completed outside of the weekly class activities, and is
  due near the end of the semester. The project requires a series of nighttime
  and/or daytime observations of the sky, as well as additional online
  component.
