<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  You are a biological being, as are the foods that you eat. We use products
  from other organisms to make many of the clothes that we wear, build our
  homes, provide medicines, and give beauty to our lives. Therefore, developing
  an appreciation and understanding of the biological world is important to
  living in this world and becoming a responsible steward of its resources. Who
  hasn't watched a bird and wondered what it would be like to be able to fly? To
  see the world from a different perspective? This course will provide an
  introduction to fundamental biological topics (including cells, energy
  transduction, genetics, evolution, organismal structure/function, ecology) for
  non-majors in biology-related fields.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
  By the time you complete this course, you should have learned about the
  following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The role of natural selection, which shapes organisms in response to their
    environment through differential reproduction.
  </li>
  <li>
    The mechanisms of inheritance, and how DNA encodes the genetic information
    for all living organisms.
  </li>
  <li>
    The chemical basis of life, the origin of life on Earth, the structure and
    function of the two basic types of cells, and how cells utilize energy.
  </li>
  <li>
    The fundamentals of plant biology, including plant structure, response, and
    reproduction.
  </li>
  <li>
    The basic organization of the animal body, with a focus on the digestive and
    reproductive systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    How organisms interact with each other and their environment, and how human
    activities have modified the environment for other organisms.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion Forums</h2>
<p>
  Throughout the 11 lessons in this course, you will be expected to participate
  in discussions on a weekly basis. There are 15 participation points available
  for each lesson, for a total of 165 points. The quality of your participation
  will determine how many points you earn. If you fully answer the questions
  posted, in an original post with no quotes or copy and paste, then you will
  earn 7 pts. If you make 2 substantial replies to your classmates’ posts, then
  you will earn 4 pts each (8 pts total) for a total of 7 + 8 = 15 pts for each
  weekly discussion forum. No late submissions accepted. If you run into any
  difficulties, please email me asap.
</p>
<h2>Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Throughout the 11 lessons in this course, you will be expected to participate
  in multiple choice quizzes on a weekly basis. These short quizzes are to help
  you understand and apply the material being learned that week. You have one
  chance to take each untimed quiz before the weekly deadline. Upon submission
  of your completed quiz, it will be automatically graded, at 10 pts for each
  quiz.
</p>
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>
  Students are expected to take exams at the scheduled times. You will have
  plenty of advance warning as to when the exams are to take place. Please see
  the calendar. Contact me if there is a problem. Only
  legitimate excuses shall warrant a makeup exam to be taken as soon as
  possible. Legitimate excuses can include, but are not limited to, illness,
  family emergencies, trips, get called into work. Sleeping through the alarm is
  NOT a legitimate excuse! Neither is ‘my car broke down’ (bring me your
  mechanic’s bill) or ‘my ISP wasn’t working’----the least you can do is be
  creative! Each open, multiple choice exam is worth 100 pts and automatically
  graded after submission. No proctors required---but Penn State’s Academic
  Integrity policy is in effect. Upon submission of each exam, you are agreeing
  to abide by Penn State’s Academic Integrity policy.
