  BIOL 141 (GN) Introductory Physiology (3): Explanation of the normal structure
  and function of the animal body, with special emphasis on human body systems.
  Students who have passed BIOL 472 may not schedule this course.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Overview</h2>
<p>
  The human body is fascinating to most of us, presumably because we have a
  rather vested interest in it. It is especially interesting when we include the
  physiology of diseases, as diseases often represent good illustrations of the
  systems not functioning properly. I have tried to include information that
  will both sustain and stimulate your interest, as well as challenge you to
  extend your knowledge outside this course. There are many good programs on TV
  and YouTube as well as articles in magazines such as Science News, Scientific
  American, Discover, Scientific American Science and Medicine, and Natural
  History that illustrate the fascinating aspects of human physiology. One of
  the goals of this course is to develop your ability to understand the more
  complex scientific and medical advances that are occurring with increasing
  frequency today.
</p>
<p>
  Physiology is not an easy subject to learn because it contains a tremendous
  amount of information. It is, however, a logical science and can usually be
  understood with reasoning. You will find it much more understandable if you
  will reason logically rather than memorize. Many of the mechanisms you will
  study can best be learned by thinking of them as a logical sequence of events.
  Learning by reasoning is not only easier but the information you learn is
  retained longer. Of course, some memory work is unavoidable. One final word
  concerning the learning of mechanisms: mechanism should not be confused with
  need. That is, if you are asked "Why?" in a lesson, you should not respond
  with "Because the body needs it to do this or that." Instead, explain the
  physiological and mechanical processes involved.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>One last note: You may be taking an online semester course for the
    first time.</strong> Online learning is different from the traditional
  classroom learning situation and can be a unique and challenging experience.
  Because there are no regular class sessions to attend, you need to be sure to
  devote enough time for each of the weekly lesson assignments. <strong>It is
    your responsibility to read all instructions for completing the assignments
    on time and to read any correspondence from the instructor.</strong> You
  must develop your own study habits and ask questions when you can’t find the
  answer yourself; this is a vital part of the learning process. You can use
  Canvas to communicate these questions as well as those from your lesson
  assignments to your instructor. I will respond as promptly as possible. I hope
  that you will enjoy this course and that you will develop an appreciation and
  enthusiasm for the amazing workings of the human body.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> You must have consistent/stable Internet access.
  Lack of internet access is not a legitimate excuse for late submission of the
  assignments. If your computer breaks down or your internet access is
  disrupted, you are responsible for going to a friend, public library, etc. in
  order to submit your assignments on time.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Course Schedule</h2>
<p>
  The schedule below outlines the topics we will be covering in this course
  along with the associated time frames and assignments. All times are Eastern
  Time Zone.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Due Dates for Assignments (Read
  Carefully)</h2>
<p>There are 2 exams for the course, each worth 200 points.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Mid-Course Exam</strong> covers only the material in Lessons 1 through
  6.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Final Exam</strong> covers only the material in Lessons 7 through 12.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The 2 Exams will be open-book but are TIMED EXAMS</strong>. You will
  have 90 minutes to complete these exams once you open them. Unlike the lessons
  assignments (see below), you cannot save them and come back to complete them
  at a later time. You are welcome to take these exams whenever you would like
  during those time periods and wherever you feel comfortable, including at
  home.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>12 Lesson Assignments (100pts each</strong> The lesson assignments are
  all open-book. You may open an assignment, begin work on it (your responses
  are automatically saved on Canvas) and come back to it at a later time. When
  you have completed the assignments and checked your responses, simply click on
  the Submit button at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4 Discussion Questions (25pts each)</strong> There are specific
  requirements for each of these questions including word count and citation of
  a reference. Please check each of the questions for details.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>If you submit your assignments after the due date, you will lose 10%
    per day for the first three days after the due date. Any assignment
    submitted AFTER 3 days past the due date will be penalized 30%. </strong>
</p>
<p>
  While many of the Lesson Assignments will have some extra credit questions
  associated with them, there will be <strong>NO EXTRA CREDIT</strong>
  assignments to try to improve your grade. The 12 Lesson Assignments are all
  open-book so be sure to take advantage of the available points on these
  assignments. I will typically have your assignments graded within 48 hours
  after you submit them.
</p>
<p>
  And while you may find it easier or more convenient to merely cut and paste
  your responses for the short answer questions on each assignment, you will
  learn a lot more (and be better prepared to take the exams) if you find the
  answer, think about what the answer tells you, and then re-write your response
  in your own words.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: Please be sure to cite any references you use to answer the short
  answer questions. If you use the textbook, cite the page number and or figure
  or table number. If you use a reference from the Internet, cite the website
  address (URL). You must include the citation of that resource as part of your
  response. If you do not include the citation, you will lose 2 points from each
  of these questions. You may also be committing plagiarism and you may be
  subject an Academic Integrity infraction.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: DO NOT use websites like Chegg or Coursehero to find answers for the
  short-answer questions on the Lesson Assignments. You will not receive credit
  for those questions if you used these sites as references.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Zoom Office Hours by Appointment</h2>
<p>
  If you would like to meet with me to discuss anything regarding the course,
  please let me know. We can set up a Zoom meeting for a virtual chat. Please
  let me know if you’d like to meet and I’ll give you details on what you’ll
  need to do and decide on a time that works for you.

<p>
  Your final grade will be based on your performance on the 12 lesson
  assignments, four discussion questions, and two exams as shown below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lesson Assignments—12 x 100 points each = 1200 points</li>
  <li>Discussion Questions—4 x 25 points each = 100 points</li>
  <li>Mid-Course Exam—200 points</li>
  <li>Final Exam—200 points</li>
  <li>Total—1700 points</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>THE EXAMS ARE NOT COMPREHENSIVE.</strong> The Mid-Course exam covers
  the material in Lessons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; the Final exam covers the
  material in Lessons 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. The examinations will be mostly
  multiple-choice questions, similar in format to the weekly assignments, with
  one or two short-answer questions.
