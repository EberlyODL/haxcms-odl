<p>
  The human body is fascinating to most of us, presumably because we have a
  rather vested interest in it. It is especially interesting when we include the
  physiology of diseases, as diseases often represent good illustrations of the
  systems not functioning properly. I have tried to include information that
  will both sustain and stimulate your interest, as well as challenge you to
  extend your knowledge outside this course. There are many good programs on the
  Public Broadcasting System and cable TV as well as articles in magazines such
  as Science News, Scientific American, Discover, Scientific American Science
  and Medicine, and Natural History that illustrate the fascinating aspects of
  human physiology. One of the goals of this course is to develop your ability
  to understand the more complex scientific and medical advances that are
  occurring with increasing frequency today.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>
  This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of human physiology for
  students in a variety of life science-related majors including Nursing,
  Kinesiology, Athletic Training, and Science. By the time you complete this
  course, you should:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a working knowledge and understanding of basic human physiology.</li>
  <li>
    Be able to apply these physiological principles to problem solving
    situations as observed in medical situations, including cardiac problems,
    hypertension, renal failure, acid-base balance disturbances, and endocrine
    imbalances.
  </li>
  <li>
    Have a practical understanding of physiology upon which you can build and
    use in future clinical settings.
  </li>
</ul>
