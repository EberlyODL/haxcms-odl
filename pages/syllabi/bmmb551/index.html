<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  What is it in your DNA that makes you different from chimpanzees, mice or
  flies? What sequences in your DNA make it more or less likely that you will
  develop diabetes or cancer?
</p>
<p>
  This course will remind students of the basic molecular biology of genes,
  introduce them to major DNA sequencing technologies, and explore how genomic
  technologies are informing principles of genome function globally, with a
  strong emphasis on identifying genes and gene regulatory modules. Students
  will use web-based bioinformatics tools for exploring genomic and epigenetic
  data to complete assignments. Each student also will develop a project on a
  topic in genomics that interests them. The goal of each project will be
  determined mainly by the studentâ€™s interest; it can be research or
  educational. The student will choose the medium used to convey the results of
  his/her work. Employing traditional media such as term papers or oral
  presentations is fine, and creative and effective use of popular media (games,
  video, music, dance, etc.) is encouraged.
</p>
<p>
  The course proceeds in two phases, first on the basics of genomics, and second
  on the search for functional elements in genomes.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>
  At the end of this course, you will successfully be able to do/perform the
  following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Describe the range of genome sizes and structures of genomes in organisms
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a wide range of sequence alignment tools with a strong appreciation of
    the power and limitations of each for the task at hand
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the community-supported online computational platform Galaxy to analyze
    files with genomic data
  </li>
  <li>
    Use online databases and resources to find information on genes,
    physiologically relevant sets of genes, and entire sets of genes from an
    organism
  </li>
  <li>
    Predict gene structures in long genome sequences
  </li>
  <li>
    Analyze processed results from massively parallel RNA determinations
    (microarray and RNA-seq) to infer functional groups of genes
  </li>
  <li>
    Interpret epigenetic patterns around individual genes and groups of genes to
    infer function
  </li>
  <li>
    Mesh results of genome-wide association studies of complex traits with
    genomic and epigenetic information to improve interpretations
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Expectations</h2>
<p>
  Students should complete each of the lessons and a semester project. The
  course will cover 14 lessons spread over the 15 weeks of the course. Each
  lesson covers a topic, and it includes reading material, presentations, and
  homework (no homework for lesson 14). Students should read the assigned texts,
  listen to the presentations, and do the homework. The text material comes from
  online textbooks, reviews and research articles. The presentations are
  provided as VoiceThreads. These are a series of slides on each topic, with a
  recorded presentation from the instructor. You can interact with the
  VoiceThread, and ask questions or make additional points.
</p>
<p>
  A homework assignment is made for 13 of the 14 lessons. Students should turn
  in a report on their work on the assignment. Sometimes you have explicit
  options on the assignment. You also can tailor the assignments to your
  particular interests. If you think of an assignment related to the topic that
  would be more meaningful or more interesting to you, it is very likely that I
  will approve it. Please check in advance of the due dates.
</p>
<p>
  Students will also complete a semester project. The student will chooses a
  topic to present or a problem on which they want to work. It is a good idea to
  discuss your interests with the instructor, so that the scope and content of
  the project can be reasonable and meaningful. Using the material in the course
  as a foundation, the student will define the topic or problem, gather
  material, and analyze data (if appropriate) to describe the topic or solve the
  problem. The student will make a report on the project by the end of the
  semester. As stated above, the medium for presentation of the project will be
  chosen by the student; creativity is welcome. Most reports are papers, but the
  report can be a presentation (e.g. using the VoiceThread technology), a film,
  a song, a comic book, a video game, a board game, a sculpture (all have been
  done in the past), or other medium.
