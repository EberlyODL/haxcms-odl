<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  Forensic science is the application of scientific principles and practices to
  matters of the law.
</p>
<p>
  This course introduces students to the field of forensic science and
  criminalist with focus on the collection, examination, evaluation, and
  interpretation of evidence. Following a single case over the semester, the
  course will review the basic applications of selected forensic science
  disciplines and will explore the underlying scientific principals and methods
  used within each. The capabilities and limitations of the forensic sciences
  will be illustrated, as well as the ways in which science contributes to the
  resolution of social and legal disputes.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Describe crime scene procedures and technologies used to reveal, collect,
    process, and transport crime scene evidence.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify the role of the criminalist within the broad scope of forensic
    science and science in general.

  It is HIGHLY recommended that you purchase the e-book. You can buy it on
  amazon.com. You do not need a kindle to read the book - just download the free
  kindle app onto your computer or device.
</p>
<p>
  The Kindle version costs approx. $6 USD and can be purchased on

<p>
  If you choose to buy the paper book instead of the e-book, no dude date
  extensions will be granted for late work because your book has has not arrived
  yet. The paper book costs about $30 USD, so it is remarkably more expensive
  than the e-book. If you still decide to purchase the physical copy, make sure
  you purchase the second edition and not the first. They are not the same. All
  online instructor provided reading and activities on the Canvas website,
  unless specifically stated to the contrary, are testable materials.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Reading</h2>
<p>
  Each module contains assigned reading. Some of the reading is from your
  textbook and some will be from online articles, websites, or content provided
  by the instructor on the course content website. All material from the reading
  is testable unless otherwise indicated.
</p>
<p>
  If you have a paper book, the page numbers are listed. If you are using an
  e-book (recommended), the page numbers may differ from the physical paper
  book. In that case, the chapter titles and/or headings are given to provide
  you with starting and stopping points.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Online Labs or Activities</h2>
<p>
  Online labs or other activities help emphasize important points from your
  reading, or help expand your understanding of the science being used to
  examine evidence. Most of this content is hosted on third-party websites that
  we do not control. If the content on one of these websites becomes unavailable
  or you have trouble accessing it, email the instructor immediately for
  assistance. We will help you troubleshoot as best we can. If you choose to
  skip the activity and move on to the quiz without seeking assistance, and are
  unable to answer quiz questions because of it, points will not be given back.
  You MUST contact one of us to troubleshoot before "giving up and moving on" if
  you cannot access a site in order for points to be granted for missed
  questions.
</p>
<p>
  If you do not already have a YouTube account, you may need to create one to
  watch many of the videos.
</p>
<p>
  The content of these labs and activities is testable material unless otherwise
  indicated.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Case Notes and Written Work</h2>
<p>
  In modules 1-11 you will have homework assignments in the form of case notes.
  While each module's case notes covers a different area of the crime scene or
  crime lab (toxicology, DNA, drugs, etc.), they are all part of the same case
  and will all have the same case number – PSUCL-01.
</p>
<p>
  Most of these assignments require you to fill in the provided
  worksheets/outlines and then submit the work for grading on Canvas. All of the
  case notes must be typewritten and submitted as a Microsoft Word or PDF
  document. If you submit your work in a format that is unreadable (bad file,
  .pages, html link, etc.), your work will be given a 0. If we can’t read it, we
  can’t – and won’t - grade it. The same goes for anyone who uses Google Docs.
  If it does funny things to the document format and alters the assignment or
  makes it unreadable, the assignment may lose points or not be graded. YOU are
  responsible for making sure your work is submitted properly and
  legible/readable.
</p>
<p>
  You will need Microsoft Word in order to complete the assignments for this
  class. As a Penn State student, you receive free access to Office 365 online.
  Every single student gets use of the Microsoft Office platforms using this
  app; therefore, no excuses of “But I don’t have Word.” or “But I use a Mac.”
  will be accepted for why your work is not in the proper format. If we cannot
  read it, we cannot grade it.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to keep up with case notes assignments throughout the semester
  - you will need this information to be complete and accurate to do the
  assignments in modules 12-14.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Evidence Summary Assignment</h2>
<p>
  In module 12 you will aggregate the results of the case notes that you have
  taken throughout the semester. Your summary will go over each piece of
  evidence by discussing the analyses performed on them and the results of those
  tests.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Drawing Conclusions Assignment</h2>
<p>
  In module 13, you will use the summary from module 12. Using your critical
  thinking skills, you will draw conclusions about the evidence in this case. Is
  it probative? Can it be associated with other evidence or people from the
  crime scene? Is your assumption about the evidence supported by science?
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Timeline of Events (Reconstruction) Assignment</h2>
<p>
  In module 14, you will use the assignment completed in module 13 to
  reconstruct the timeline of events from the crime scene, as well as discuss
  some alternate theories of the case. Based on the conclusions you come to in
  module 13, your timeline may vary greatly from those of your fellow
  classmates. This is expected and acceptable, as long as your timeline is
  backed up by your scientific interpretation of the evidence.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Forensic Science Professional Profiles</h2>
<p>
  The majority of the textbook is dedicated to criminalistics, but there are
  many other sciences that can be included under the forensic science umbrella.
  There are ten forensic science specialties discussed throughout the course.
  Each of these will include short reading assignments, a possible online
  activity or lab, and a 5 question, 5 point quiz.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Forensic Science Career Assignment</h2>
<p>
  Part of exploring any profession is understanding what it takes to be a part
  of it. You will examine job postings for crime scene, crime lab, and forensic
  specialty work in order to explore what it takes to enter the forensic science
  field. This is also an opportunity to see how the courses you take and the
  skills you develop in the classroom are directly applicable to your career
  once you leave Penn State.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Forensic Science Education Assignment</h2>
<p>
  As you will see from the Career Assignment, the educational requirements for
  jobs in the forensic science field vary widely depending on the type of work
  you want to do. For the Education Assignment, you will examine different
  degree options in relation to the job postings you analyzed during the Career
  Assignment to explore the differences between these degrees and why certain
  degrees may be necessary for some jobs but not others.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Photography Assignments</h2>
<p>
  You will have five photography assignments throughout the semester. They will
  each cover different uses and necessities of photography throughout a case
  including the use of photography for crime scene investigation (CSI),
  documentation of victims and suspects, initial evidence examination,
  documentation of evidence analysis, and finally the use of these photos as
  evidence or documentation in the courtroom.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Each module has a 10 question, 10 point quiz that you will have 10 minutes to
  complete. The quizzes contain multiple choice and true/false questions. All
  material in the module - except for the professional profile - is fair game
  for the quiz.
</p>
<p>
  Quiz questions are randomly drawn from a question bank specific to the module
  in which you are taking the quiz. Each bank may have up to 50 questions. The
  questions are pulled from the textbook reading, Canvas page reading, articles
  and third party website information, videos, and online labs/activities. While
  the quiz is open book, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you take some notes to
  use on your quiz and exams as you complete each module. Students who try to do
  the reading and take the quiz simultaneously generally run out of time because
  there is not enough time to do both.
</p>
<p>
  Each professional profile has a 5 question, 5 point quiz that you will have 10
  minutes to complete. The quizzes contain multiple choice and true/false
  questions. These quiz questions will only be on the information in the
  professional profile - no other content from the module will be in the 5 point
  quiz.
</p>
<p>
  Quizzes are open book and open note - they are not open friend. Make sure your
  work is your own.
</p>
<p>
  All quizzes will be available on Canvas. Check the calendar and module pages
  for due dates.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Case Note Quiz</h2>
<p>
  The formatting of case notes in forensic science is guided by some very strict
  standards and guidelines. In the world of forensic science, case notes are
  considered a legal document, and if they are done incorrectly, they can get
  thrown out of court. You will be introduced to the basics of proper case notes
  documentation in this class. The format you are being asked to follow is a
  bare bones version of what anyone entering a law enforcement or forensics
  profession will encounter. This is also a good introduction to the handwritten
  version of case notes you will encounter in FRNSC 210 if you intend to pursue
  the forensic science major at Penn State.
</p>
<p>
  Every semester, students needlessly lose points on their case notes
  assignments because they refuse to follow the format (or simply ignore the
  directions). This quiz is designed to make sure you understand the format that
  is required for case notes - especially the date and time.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Exams</h2>
<p>
  You will have three exams, each worth 100 points. Exams have 100 multiple
  choice and true/false questions. The questions are drawn from the question
  banks used to make the module quizzes. It is likely you will see some of the
  same questions on your exam that you had on a previous quiz - these will be
  mixed in with new questions you have not seen before.
</p>
<p>
  You will have 1 hour (60 minutes) to complete each exam. While the exams are
  open book, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you take some notes to use on your
  exams as you complete each module. It is also HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you
  study for this exam the same as you would any other. If you are unfamiliar
  with the material, you will have trouble finishing the exam on time - there is
  not enough time to look up every single answer in your notes or on Canvas
  while taking the exam.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Extra Credit</h2>
<p>
  The instructor will have VoiceThread or Kaltura lectures throughout the
  modules for you to watch. A VoiceThread or Kaltura lecture is like a
  PowerPoint lecture - you watch the slides while I talk over them. However,
  these are NOT traditional lectures. They will vary in length and complexity
  depending on the subject matter being discussed and there is not a lecture for
  every module. These lectures are designed to help explain concepts and
  assignments that students have struggled with in the past. It is worth your
  while to watch them with your full attention - do not do other work, watch
  Netflix, or engage in other distractions. Lectures are considered testable
  material unless otherwise stated.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Class Discussion on Piazza</h2>
<p>
  There are no discussion boards or group projects required in this class. That
  being said, students in previous classes have expressed a desire for there to
  be some sort of voluntary discussion forum where they can post questions or
  discuss assignments with fellow students. I have set up Piazza so that you can
  do just that. These forums will be monitored, so do not use them to cheat.
  Pointing a student to the correct section of the textbook to find and answer
  is acceptable – telling them the answer is not. This is the ONLY place where
  students are authorized to “collaborate” within this course.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Late Submission Policy</h2>
<p>
  Late quizzes and exams will not be accepted without prior permission from the
  instructor.
</p>
<p>
  Very late work may be accepted on a case-by-case basis. Students with
  long-term or serious illnesses or experiencing catastrophic life events have
  been granted extensions in the past. Doctor's notes or other documentation may
  be required. Again, extensions are not guaranteed, and are granted on a
  case-by-case basis by the instructor.
</p>
