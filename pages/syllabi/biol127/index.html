<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Cellular structure and organization; physiological processes; classification;
  reproduction and development; relationship of plant groups. Students who have
  passed BIOL 240W may not schedule this course
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>During the course of the semester, the student will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Develop critical thinking skills, gather credible information, question
    ideas from a scientific viewpoint
  </li>
  <li>Learn and integrate terms and concepts in plant biology</li>
  <li>
    Understand how plant structure (cellular, organismal) and function
    (biochemical) are tied together
  </li>
  <li>
    Learn how plants and humans interact and the outcomes of this interaction
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop laboratory skills to investigate plant evolution, anatomy, and
    physiology
  </li>
  <li>
    Design an experimental approach that addresses a concept in plant biology
  </li>
  <li>
    Summarize, in the style of a scientific journal article, the design,
    rationale, results, interpretation, and conclusions of a scientific
    experiment or studyP
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Required Materials</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Bidlack J., Jansky S., and Stern K. Stern’s Introductory Plant Biology, 13th
    ed. ISBN-13: 978- 0073369440, ISBN-10: 0073369446
  </li>
  <li>
    Carolina Biological Botany Lab Kits Purchase at:
    https://www.carolina.com/carolina-distancelearning-science-kits/the-pennsylvania-state-university-introductory-plant-biology-biol-127/581864.pr
  </li>
  <li>
    Digital camera with ability to upload pictures to Canvas
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Attendance / Participation</h2>
<p>
  You will be expected to check in every day or every other day for any
  announcements or updates. The amount of time spent looking over the material
  typically is correlated with quiz and exam grade: the more time spent studying
  usually translates into a better grade. Although this is an online course, you
  should expect to spend a similar amount of time on the material that you would
  for an inperson class. The general rule for studying is as follows: for every
  one hour of lecture, you should spend 2.5 to 3 hours studying the material.
  That means for a three-credit course, you should spend 7.5 to 9 hours per week
  studying and completing assignments if you intend to do well (“A” or “B”
  level).
</p>
<h2>Labs</h2>
<p>
  You will complete 11 labs related to the material covered during that week.
  The lab materials must be ordered through Carolina Biological Supplies, and
  will be delivered to your home. The labs are designed for you to complete at
  your home, with the exception of one lab, where you will be required to go to
  a local park, arboretum, or botanical garden. Though in some cases the lab
  will reinforce concepts covered in the book and in the PowerPoints, the lab
  may also cover a unique topic. For this reason, material covered in lab
  activities will be included on exams. If you have completed all 11 labs, only
  your 10 best scores will count towards your grade.
</p>
<h2>Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Each week one or more short quizzes covering that week’s chapter contents must
  be completed. The quizzes are designed to ensure that you keep up with your
  reading and study. The quizzes will be in a true/false, matching, or
  multiple-choice type format and are intended to reinforce the main concepts in
  each chapter. Utilize the weekly objectives as a study guide for the quizzes
  and exams. These quizzes will only be open for a limited time, so do not go
  for extended periods of time (days, weeks) without having logged into the
  course. I typically do not re-open quizzes unless in the case of technical
  difficulties from my end. If you miss one or a few quizzes, this will not
  negatively affect your grade. If you have taken all 23 quizzes, only your 20
  best scores will count towards your grade.
</p>
<h2>Video Discussions</h2>
<p>
  During the semester, you will watch two documentaries: The Botany of Desire,
  broken into four parts of 30 minutes each, and America’s Lost Landscape: The
  Tallgrass Prairie which is 60 minutes. This is a total of five discussion
  forums. For each forum, you will be asked to post a response or answers
  questions. Your first post is due 24 hours prior to the due date for the
  assignment. If the post is late, no points will be awarded (see discussion
  instructions in the week 1 module on Canvas for more detailed instructions).
  The discussions are worth 25 points each.
</p>
<h2>Lab Report</h2>
<p>
  One lab will require that you write a formal lab report. This is meant to give
  you practice at scientific writing. You will complete a peer-review draft, a
  rough draft, and a final draft (see the instruction in the Effects of Ethylene
  on Fruit Ripening Lab and the individual Lab Report assignments on Canvas for
  more details).
</p>
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>
  During the semester, you will have three exams and a final exam over the
  material covered. These exams will include true/false, multiple-choice, and/or
  matching questions; in addition there may be diagrams to label and/or short
  free-response questions. Exams will cover material for each “unit”: Exam 1
  will cover material from the beginning of the course until the first exam,
  Exam 2 will cover material after Exam 1 until the second exam, and so forth.
  The final will be similar in format to the midterm exams. The only differences
  will be that the final will be slightly (about 50%) longer, and will be
  cumulative. The cumulative section will be about 33% of the final, and the
  remainder will be material covered after the third midterm. All exams will be
  delivered online, but they will be proctored, using Examity (see Examity
  section under University Policies). You will have a window of about 72 hours
  to take your exam, but you must schedule it in advance through the Examity tab
  in Canvas. If you make changes to your scheduled exam time less than 24 hours
  before the start of the exam window, Examity will charge you a fee of $3.
