<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  The semester is divided into roughly 4-week periods for each of the three
  major units:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Unit 1:</strong> Spacetime, Special and General Relativity – Newton’s
  and Einstein’s Theories of Gravity, Definition of Black Holes, Absoluteness of
  the Speed of Light, Time Dilation, Length Contraction, Mass Increase, the Twin
  Paradox, Equivalence Principle, Gravitational Time Dilation, Effects of
  Gravity on Light, Evidence of Relativity
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Unit 2:</strong> Types of Black Holes and their Characteristics – How
  do Black Holes form, Binary Stars and Accretion Disks, Supermassive Black
  Holes in Centers of Galaxies, How to Detect a Black Hole, Active Galactic
  Nuclei, Jets
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Unit 3:</strong> Evaporation of Black Holes, Wormholes and Time Travel
  – Gravitational Waves, Kerr Black Holes, Hawking Radiation, What's inside a
  black hole, Black holes that formed in the early universe, Wormholes and time
  travel.
</p>
<p>
  You can work through the online material at a pace that suits you best, but be
  aware that at the end of each 5-week period, there will be an exam covering
  that unit's material (3 exams + the final exam). Exams are in multiple choice
  format. The final exam will be cumulative.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>
  This course is intended to introduce students to the predicted properties of
  black holes and the astronomical evidence for their existence. Along the way
  we will study modern ideas about the nature of space, time, and gravity. After
  taking this course, students should be able to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Describe the key ideas of special and general relativity and the evidence
    for each
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the difference between Newton’s and Einstein's theories of
    gravity
  </li>
  <li>
    Explain what is a black hole, how one forms, and what happens near it and to
    objects falling into a black hole
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe the difference between stellar mass and supermassive black holes,
    and how to detect each type
  </li>
  <li>
    Explain what is an Active Galactic Nuclei and describe why black holes have
    jets
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe how black holes can loose energy through Hawking radiation and
    possibility of wormholes
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We will spend the first few weeks discussing Einstein's ideas about space,
  time, and gravity since these ideas are absolutely critical for a proper
  understanding of black holes. Do not worry if black holes do not make an
  immediate appearance in the first couple weeks; they will be coming and will
  certainly be the main focus of the course.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Requirements</h2>
<p>
  Please note that Astro 1 is a prerequisite for this class, and you will be
  expected to perform very simple mathematical calculations. Examples will be
  given in the course notes. Examples of the mathematical concepts we will use
  in this class are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Scientific notation
  </li>
  <li>
    Multiplying and dividing powers of 10
  </li>
  <li>
    Converting between different metric units
  </li>
  <li>
    Rearranging and solving simple equations, taking a quantity to a power
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Exams</h2>
<p>
  There will be 3 scheduled exams plus a cumulative final exam. Dates for the
  exams are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Exam 1: February 9-12
  </li>
  <li>
    Exam 2: March 23 - 26
  </li>
  <li>
    Exam 3: April 20 - 23
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  No make up exams are given except for serious medical emergencies or
  legitimate unavoidable conflicts related to university business (these must be
  documented).
</p>
<p>
  Exams are closed book and closed notes; you are not allowed to use any
  webpages, notes, electronic devices, other people, or any other outside
  resources to assist you on the exam. You can have a pen/pencil and scratch
  paper to help work out some questions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Final Exam: The final exam is cumulative</strong>,covering material
  across the entire semester. There are no make-ups for the final exam.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Homework</h2>
<p>
  We will have homework assignments during the course. These will be announced
  one week before the due date.
</p>
<p>
  I encourage you to start the work on the problem set by yourself as soon as it
  is assigned. Homework counts for 25% of your final grade! This means that you
  should take it seriously. Do not wait until the end of the time period to
  complete the homework. The homework assignments will take you several hours,
  so if you leave them to the last minute, you’ll be in trouble—and it will be
  too late for you to ask for help. No extensions or make-ups will be given.
</p>
<p>
  You are encouraged to discuss the homework problems on Piazza.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Participation</h2>
<p>
  You will be graded on the basis of completion of a unit. You must complete the
  material for the relevant Unit before the exam period begins. You can do this
  at your own pace and convenience, however do be sure to allow enough time. It
  is probably best to do a bit each week, as opposed to leaving everything for
  the last day before the test period. In total, we expect about the same amount
  of your time to be required as in a traditional lecture class.
</p>
<p>
  During the semester you must participate in a discussion on Piazza at least
  once. You can either post a question, or comment on a posted question. Only
  astronomy related questions count. You will not receive credit for questions
  related to the logistics of the class.

  Grades are not rounded in any way, and the scale is designed to give the
  highest grades possible at the end of the semester to everyone. There is no
  extra credit in this class.
