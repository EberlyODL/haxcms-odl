<p>
  The purpose of this course is to provide students with a foundation in the
  various applications of high-throughput sequencing including: chip-Seq,
  RNA-Seq, SNP calling, metagenomics, de-novo assembly and others. The course
  material will concentrate on presenting complete data analysis scenarios for
  each of these domains of applications and will introduce students to a wide
  variety of existing tools and techniques.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of the course work students will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understand common bioinformatics data formats and standards</li>
  <li>
    Become familiar with the practice of analyzing sequencing data from various
    instruments
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop the computationally oriented thinking that is necessary to take on
    large-scale data analysis projects
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Lessons</h2>
<p>
  The Lessons will provide you with general background information and practical
  examples that tie in with the topic. We will share some real life exercises
  and the homework will give you a chance to apply what you have learned for
  each lesson.
</p>
<p>We will cover five topics throughout the course:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Core Informatics Competency
  </li>
  <li>
    Computational Foundations
  </li>
  <li>
    Biological Data Formats
  </li>
  <li>
    Statistical Methods and Visualization
  </li>
  <li>
    Software Tools and their Applications
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Assignments</h2>
<p>
  At the end of each lesson, there will be a homework to assess your
  comprehension of the content.
</p>
<p>
  Homework will usually fit on one sheet of paper. You will need to show the
  commands and their output. You additionally can print screens, but please DO
  NOT pring a console output of white text on black background!
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Grading</h2>
<p>
  Your grade for the course will be the weighted average of all homeworks and a
  final project.
</p>
<p>
  The final project (weight-20%) will be similar, but more complex than a
  typical homework and will require that you use the knowledge of the concepts
  learned throughout the entire course.
</p>
<p>You may work in teams if you wish.</p>
