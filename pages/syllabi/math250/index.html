<p>
  In this course, students will learn how derivatives commonly appear in
  equations used to describe the world. Equations involving derivatives are
  called differential equations. Differential equations play an important role
  in modeling the real world. Newton's laws, Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism,
  Einstein's equations of general relativity, Euler and Bernoulli's beam
  equation, the Black-Scholes equation from finance, Perelson's viral-dynamics
  equations in biology, and the million-dollar NavierStokes equations are all
  differential equations used daily in their respective disciplines. Today,
  differential equations are one of the fundamental mathematical tools for the
  study of systems that change over time, and are used in most areas of science,
  engineering, and mathematics. MATH 250 is an introductory course on ordinary
  differential equations. Ordinary differential equations are equations that
  involve derivative of a function with respect to only one variable. The goal
  of this course is to teach the students some of the elementary techniques in
  dealing with several fundamental types of equations. Some topics include
  linear equations involving only first and second derivatives, Laplace
  transforms, systems of linear equations involving only first derivatives, and
  phase-plane analysis.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Prerequisite</h2>
<p>
  MATH 141, MATH 141B, or MATH 141H. Students who have passed Math 250 and Math
  252 cannot schedule Math 251 for credit.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>
  In this course, our focus will be on the study of Ordinary Differential
  Equations (ODEs). Topics include, but are not limited to the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Classify ODEs in terms of type and order</li>
  <li>Analyze the asymptotic behavior of autonomous differential equations</li>
  <li>
    Learn methods for solving first, second, and some higher-order differential
    equations. Methods will include, but not limited to:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Separation of variables</li>
    <li>
      Integrating factor method for first order linear differential equations
    </li>
    <li>Method of characteristic equation</li>
    <li>Laplace transform solutions</li>
    <li>Initial value problems</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Solving linear and nonlinear systems of differential equations</li>
  <li>Stability of critical points</li>
  <li>
    Analyze behavior of linear and nonlinear systems of differential equations,
  </li>
  <li>
    Apply the knowledge of differential equations to explain real life phenomena
    (population dynamics (including Logistic Growth), exponential growth and
    decay, circuit equations, spring-mass, linear and non-linear predator-pray
    models, linear and non-linear cooperation models, and others)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Textbook</h2>
<p>
  I encourage everyone to purchase the WebAssign Access, which comes with the
  Ebook access (this is the best value). However, if one prefers a hard copy of
  the textbook, then it is Differential Equations with Boundary value problems,
  9th ed, by Dennis Zill. Students must also have to purchase access to
  WebAssign if they purchase a text not packaged with WebAssign access code.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Homework</h2>
<p>
  Homework sets will be assigned weekly and need to be accessed and completed
  through WebAssign. Students are given five chances to answer each problem, use
  these attempts as a mean to comprehend the material. Homework is essential to
  success in this course. For each homework assignment, there will be 5 attempts
  per each question.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  After each homework assignment, there will be a quiz to complete on WebAssign.
  For each quiz, there will be 3 attempts per each question.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Exams</h2>
<p>
  During the semester we will have two midterm examinations each one worth 100
  points, and a comprehensive final examination that is worth 150 points. Dates
  of the exams are all set on CNAVAS. You, the student, must sign up for the
  exam to secure a proctor, which instructions are also available on CANVAS.
