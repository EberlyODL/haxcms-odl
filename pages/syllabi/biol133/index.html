<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  This course is an overview of our current knowledge of human heredity, genetic
  issues, genetic diseases, and human evolution. Background information that is
  necessary for understanding these issues will be taught including cell
  structure, the structure and function of DNA and chromosomes, patterns of
  inheritance, population genetics, human evolution, and genetic technologies.
  This course is intended for non-biology majors and does not include a detailed
  analysis of human genetics. This course will include Canvas readings,
  web-based readings and videos, and web-based interactive exercises. There are
  ample opportunities for individual problem-solving while group assignments are
  offered as discussion forums. Students will also research genetic conditions
  and have the opportunity to share what they have learned.

  one quiz, you will be required to use the PSU online proctoring system,
  Examity. Please see additional specific information below.
</p>
<p>
  In this class you will take one assessment that will be proctored by a service
  called Examity®. Review the Student Quick-Guide, which is available in the
  modules tab, for instructions on how to use Examity®. Please log in as soon as

<p>
  Web Activities are assigned for almost all modules via links to web resources
  to learn more about a specific topic. Each web site has associated questions
