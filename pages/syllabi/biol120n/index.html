<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  This course is designed to introduce you to the discipline of plant biology
  and increase your awareness and appreciation of the impact of plants on your
  daily lives. The first part of the course will present the fundamentals of
  botany to provide you with a basic understanding of plant form and function.
  The rest of the course will be devoted to a survey of historical, cultural,
  and economic aspects of botany and related fields. We will finish up with an
  examination of the role of plants as an integral part of the world's
  ecosystem.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Course Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    To explore the world of plants, particularly those that have propped up or
    supported human civilizations in important ways
  </li>
  <li>
    To gain a basic understanding of plant anatomy with focus on anatomical
    traits that were desired by humans for their use
  </li>
  <li>To understand how plants grow, live, and reproduce</li>
  <li>
    To compare and contrast traditional vs. modern ways of domesticating crops
    and producing plant-based products
  </li>
  <li>
    To explore plant use by humans historically and globally using agriculture,
    food, and medicine, as examples beginning with the first humans and ending
    in modern day
  </li>
  <li>
    To consider how plants are being used for sustainability purposes, including
    as biofuels and for green architecture and environmental clean-up
  </li>
  <li>
    To communicate about the science and historical importance of plants in
    society, in written form using evidence-based approaches to support
    arguments
  </li>
  <li>
    To collaborate with peers to teach classmates in an effective and engaging
    manner
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Weekly Expectations</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    (3-4 hours) Read course material, watch videos, take notes, and participate
    in discussion forums in your weekly modules.
  </li>
  <li>
    (2-3 hours) Complete a homework assignment that will either involve a video
    or some reading followed by some guiding questions.
  </li>
  <li>
    (40 minutes) Take a 20 question, timed exam on the material you explored
    every two weeks in the course (Last Day of Weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13).
  </li>
  <li>
    A group project will be due the Friday of week 11 with the assignment load
    reduced in the week leading up to it. Parts of the project will be built
    earlier in the course as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Group Plant Lessons Based On Your Plant From Your Book: The goal is for each
    plant book group to create 40 minute Wikipage style lessons that are
    engaging and include important stories as to why your particular plant
    is/was so useful to human civilizations. These lessons will be due by the
    end of week 11. Use my CANVAS lessons as models, but feel free to be
    creative and teach however you think will be engaging and informative. For a
    complete overview of this project, click here.

<p>
  Our weekly course schedule for the semester can be accessed via Canvas.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Required Material</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Access to internet to view and watch course materials on CANVAS. It is your
    responsibility to have internet access in an online course, with free
    internet availability at certain coffeehouses and the public library if you
    have connectivity issues at some point during the semester.
  </li>
  <li>
    After selecting your plant group at the end of week #1, purchase one plant
    book, which will be discussed in your groups and used as a resource to
    develop a lesson based on that plant for your classmates to engage with
    later in the course.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Late Policy</h2>
<p>
  Since you are given a full week to complete each module, at your convenience,
  late assignments will not be tolerated. Starting after the drop/add (Week 2),
  quizzes and discussion forums will close each Monday at 11:59 PM ET with no
  opportunity for make-ups without a University-recognized excuse. Homework
  assignments will be docked -25% in the first 24 hours of being late, -50% in
  the next 48 hours of being late, and then will receive a zero for anything
  later than that. Penn State University provides a listing of recognized
  excuses for absence; include appropriate documentation from a doctor or other
  Pennsylvania State University recognized reasons, such as a religious holiday
  or participation as an athlete in a D1 sports event.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Assignment of Final Grades</h2>
<p>
  Exams are 42% of your course grade and participation, homework, and projects
  are 58% of your course grade.
</p>
<p>
  Final grades will be calculated from your earned grades in the course, with no
  curve as follows:
</p>
<p>
  A = 92.0-100 A- = 90.0-91.9 B+ = 88.0-89.9 B = 82.0-87.9 B- = 80.0-81.9 C+ =
  78.0-79.9 C = 70.0-77.9 D = 60-69.9.
</p>
