<h2>Proctor Information</h2>
<p>
  You will need to secure a proctor in order to take exams in this course. A
  proctor will not automatically be assigned to you; rather, you must make the
  necessary contacts to secure a professional who will serve in this capacity.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Contact a person who meets the qualifications and ask him or her to proctor
    your exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    Student Services must approve your proctor before any exams can be taken.
    Please see instructions for <a href="https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/courses/proctored-exams">securing a suitable proctor</a>
. While many proctors
    will serve on a voluntary basis, you are responsible for paying any expenses
    incurred in retaining a proctor.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must submit your proctor for approval or schedule your exams at a
    testing center using our online proctored exam portal. You will need to
    enter your proctor's contact information and submit proctor verification
    documentation. Note: If your proctor has been previously approved by the
    World Campus during a prior course within two years, you do not need to
    obtain verification. World Campus retains proctor information on file for
    two years. To learn more about using the online portal, visit the World
    Campus website "<a href="https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/a-z-index/using-the-proctored-exam-portal">Using the Proctored Exam Portal</a>
."
  </li>
  <li>
    If your proctor does not meet the required specifications, Student Services
    will notify you within 5 to 7 business days.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are a graduating senior requesting a final exam, please see
    additional information about early deadlines for course completion and exam
    scheduling.
  </li>
  <li>
    Contact <a href="https://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/contacts-help">Student Services</a>
 if you cannot take a scheduled exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless you have received permission to take your exam at an alternative
    time, your proctor will only allow you to take the exam during dates
    specified in your course.
