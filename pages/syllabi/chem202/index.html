<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  CHEM 202 is a one-semester, comprehensive course that introduces the students
  to the fundamental principles of organic chemistry including relationships
  between the molecular structure of organic compounds and their macroscopic
  properties. Some of the principles are illustrated with a variety of examples
  from nature and everyday life. The course covers the following topics:
  alkanes; alkenes, including polymers; alkynes; benzene and aromaticity;
  alcohols and phenols; ethers; aldehydes; ketones; carboxylic acids and their
  acyl derivatives; amines; alkyl halides; nomenclature; stereochemistry,
  including conformational analysis and chirality. Chemical reactions of the
  functional groups will be discussed along with the mechanistic details,
  including stereospecificity, of some of these processes. Biological molecules
  such as carbohydrates, lipids, steroids, peptides/proteins and nucleic acids,
  along with their importance in living systems, will be surveyed.
</p>
<p>
  To achieve these goals, we will study the structure and function of organic
  molecules with emphasis on their physical properties and chemical
  reactivities. An understanding of the structure and function of various
  functional groups is essential to master the content of this course.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>When you successfully complete this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Draw chemical structures for any given chemical formula and be able to name
    the molecules based on IUPAC nomenclature rules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify and draw constitutional and conformational structural isomers for a
    given formula or structure, including stereoisomers and geometric isomers
    and understand the relationship between them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe bonding- ionic, covalent, hydrogen bonding and van der Waals
    bonding and understand the concept of hybridization leading to single and
    multiple covalent bonding.
  </li>
  <li>
    Differentiate between bonding, non-bonded interactions and inductive effects
    in the determination of physical properties such as bond polarity, boiling
    points and solubility.
  </li>
  <li>
    Name all classes of molecules. Nomenclature of alkanes, alkenes, alkyl
    halides, aromatic compounds, alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, ketones,
    carboxylic acids and derivatives of carboxylic acids is important.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write chemical reactions and know chemical reagents, reactants and products
    for reactions of alkanes, alkyl halides, alcohols, ethers, aromatic
    compounds, aldehydes, ketones, amines, carboxylic acids and derivatives.
  </li>
  <li>
    Write stepwise reaction mechanisms for nucleophilic substitution reactions
    (SN1 and SN2), elimination reactions (E1 and E2), electrophilic aromatic
    substitutions, nlectrophilic acyl substitution reactions and addition
    reactions, including polymerizations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify enantiomers and diastereomers (meso), optically activity, racemes;
    E/Z geometrical isomers for unsaturated compounds.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each Lesson contains narrated introductory slides (the PowerPoint slides have
  an audio component), a quiz, and slides from Office Hours.
</p>

</h2>
<p>(13 x 20 points each / Drop the two lowest / 60 minutes per attempt)</p>
<p>
  Each lesson will conclude with a quiz which is based on the learning goals
  listed at the end of the Narrated Introductory Slides. If you know how to
  solve the homework problems, you will be able to solve a set of the homework
  problems assigned as a quiz. The best 11 quiz grades will be count. Quiz
  assignments will not be proctored and have to be completed by the due date and
