<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The Astro 1 Web section follows the same course outline as other sections of
  Astro 1, with the term divided into roughly equal-length periods for each of
  the four major units:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Basic Astronomy and the Nighttime Sky: seasons, phases of the Moon, the
    night sky, eclipses, constellations, properties of light, spectroscopy,
    Doppler effect, telescopes.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Solar System: properties of the planets in our solar system, including
    the Earth and its Moon as well as moons of other planets, laws of planetary
    motion, formation of the solar system, age of the solar system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stars & the Milky Way Galaxy: the Sun, properties of stars (how they work,
    mass, luminosity, temperature, color), stellar birth and death, white
    dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, star clusters, gas and dust, structure
    and composition of the Milky Way Galaxy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Galaxies and Cosmology: different types and sizes of galaxies, galaxy
    evolution, dark matter and dark energy, the Big Bang theory and the history
    of the universe, quasars and gamma ray bursts, extra dimensions and parallel
    universes.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
  To engage students in an investigation of astronomy in a more active way so
  that they will achieve a greater understanding. To cultivate a heightened
  sense of excitement about recent developments in the field at the same time as
  teaching basic concepts. To convey the idea that astronomy has relevance to
  many people, through appreciation of beauty of astronomical objects.
</p>
<p>
  After taking this course, students should be able to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Describe the position of the Earth in the Universe, in orbit around the Sun
    which is one of many stars traveling around the center of the Milky Way
    galaxy that is one of billions and billions of galaxies in the Universe
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe why the Sun shines and why stars come in different colors; • give a
    brief history of the universe from the beginning of the Big Bang expansion
    to the formation of galaxies, stars, and planets
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe the basic properties of the planets in the Solar System and their
    moons
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the motions of our Sun, Moon, and stars in the sky over the
    course of days, months, and years
  </li>
  <li>
    Remember three things that are relevant and important about astronomy ten
    years down the line
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand and have interest in newspaper and magazine articles on astronomy
    written for the public
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>
  The details about how your tests will be given will be emailed to you
  separately, nearer to each testing period.
</p>
<p>
  For the Fall 2019 semester, the dates [MM/DD] for testing are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Unit 1 (reading and all quizzes): 09/15
  </li>
  <li>
    Test 1: 09/19 - 09/22
  </li>
  <li>
    Unit 2 (reading and all quizzes): 10/06
  </li>

</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Please make a note of the exam dates on your calendar.</strong>
  Each unit's reading material, and the "Summary Quizzes" must be completed by
  the evening (by 11:59 PM Eastern time) exactly one week before the last day of
  the testing period on that unit, for full Reading Completion credit.
</p>
<p>
  You can do this course generally at your own pace and convenience, however, do
  be sure to allow enough time. It is best to do a bit each week, as opposed to
  leaving everything for the last day before the assignment is due. 
</p>
<p>
  No makeup exams are allowed, except for official University scheduled trips or serious
  medical emergencies (with appropriate documentation).
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Complete the online material — four "Units" & their "Parts" and the Participation quizzes
  </li>
  <li>
    Complete the pre-course Survey and post-course Survey; • Take 3 of 4
    midterm exams (recommended to take them all, but the lowest score will be
    dropped)
  </li>
  <li>
    Take the Final Exam
  </li>
  <li>
    Participate in the Unit 3 Discussion Group assignment
  </li>
  <li>
    Write a short essay for the wrap up at the end of Unit 4
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In total, we expect about the same amount of your time to be required as in a
  traditional lecture class in Astro 1. You will see many multiple-choice
  questions dispersed through the material and you must correctly answer these to
  progress. If you get them wrong you are usually given hints, and can try again.
</p>
<p>
  For each of a Unit's Parts there is a short Summary Quiz, to be completed in
  Canvas (find it in the "Modules" area). You will be graded on the basis of
  completing the Summary Quizzes. You get multiple tries to answer all of the
  questions; you do not have to answer all of the questions correctly on the first
  try. However, to earn full participation credit for a Unit, you do need to get
  all of the questions on the quiz correct before the testing period for that Unit
  begins.
</p>
<h2>Course Prerequisites</h2>
<p>None</p>
<h2>Grading Policy</h2>
<p>Your overall grade — out of 100% — is calculated based on the following... </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    20% for the cumulative Final Exam
  </li>
  <li>
    20% total for participation, broken up into:
  </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1% for completion of the Astronomy Surveys (in two parts — a pre- and postcourse survey)
      </li>
      <li>
        2% for participation in Discussion Board assignment (during Unit 3)
      </li>
      <li>
        2% for a 1-page essay to be written upon completion of Unit 4
      </li>
      <li>
        15% for completion of online material (as recorded by your best score on the Summary Quizzes)
      </li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
  The guaranteed grading boundaries (i.e., you will receive at least this grade if you have this final average) are:
