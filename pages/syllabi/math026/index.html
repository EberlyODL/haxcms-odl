<p>Trigonometry, 2nd Edition by John W. Coburn (McGraw-Hill, 2010).</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Course Format</h2>
<p>
  Both algebraic skills and conceptual understanding will be expected and
  assessed.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Basic Skills</h2>
<p>
  Basic skills will be primarily developed through work on ALEKS. ALEKS is a
  web-based tutorial system which provides students with ongoing skills based
  assessments and tracks progress. The final exam will also entail skills based
  problems.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Conceptual Skills</h2>
<p>
  Conceptual skills will be incorporated in lectures, reading, and quizzes.
  Lectures will be conducted approximately every other week. A typical lecture
  will tie skill based ideas together to provide a larger overview of the
  topics. Lectures will be done via Zoom and activities will be based upon
  discussion board prompts and/or assigned tasks from the text. The final exam
  will also incorporate questions which relate to the conceptual tasks.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">ALEKS Work</h2>
<p>
  Essentially all of the skills based work will be conducted through ALEKS. The
  ALEKS system will do ongoing assessments of skills based problems and track
  student progress. ALEKS is a major component of the course and a typical
  trigonometry student will need to plan on 4–6 hours of online work each week
  (50–60 hours for the course). Skills based points will be earned by measuring
  mastered objective milestones and skills based ALEKS quizzes.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Text-book Reading & Suggested Problems</h2>
<p>
  The text will be primarily used to tie ideas to concepts and skills together.
  This will be done through assigned readings and suggested problems.
  Occasionally, a problem may be selected to emphasize a specific skill that
  ALEKS did not adequately incorporate. Some of the activities will stem from
  the text. Finally, the text will support the ALEKS work in that explanations
  within ALEKS will reference specific areas from the text for further reading.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Canvas Work</h2>
<p>
  The course management system is Canvas and most correspondence will be
  conducted here. Canvas quizzes will be used for conceptual based quizzes, the
  midterm exams and the final exam.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Class Participation</h2>
<p>
  Zoom is the web-conference utility where the virtual classroom resides. This
  may also be used for more “face-to-face” group correspondence with students.
  Canvas discussion boards will be used for more general “open” classroom
  interaction between students and the instruction team. Students are encouraged
  to post questions on this advanced bulletin board.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Grading</h2>
<p>
  The total number of points for the course will be 600 points as described
  below.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Arranging a Proctor</h2>
<p>
  You will need to secure a proctor in order to take exams in this course. A
  proctor will not automatically be assigned to you; rather, you must make the
  necessary contacts to secure a professional who will serve in this capacity.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Contact a person who meets the qualifications and ask him or her to proctor
    your exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    Student Services must approve your proctor before any exams can be taken.
    Please see instructions for securing a
    <a
      style="text-decoration: none; color:#e2801e;"
      href="https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/courses/proctored-exams"
      target="_blank"
    >
      suitable proctor</a
    >
    . While many proctors will serve on a voluntary basis, you are responsible
    for paying any expenses incurred in retaining a proctor.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must complete a Proctor Information Form and submit the completed form
    with the proctor verification documentation. Note: If your proctor has been
    previously approved by the World Campus during a prior course within two
    years, you do not need to obtain verification. World Campus retains proctor
    information on file for two years.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your proctor does not meet the required specifications, Student Services
    will notify you within 5 to 7 business days.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will need to complete an Exam Request Form for each exam. Contact your
    proctor to confirm the date, time, and location of your exam(s). Complete
    the form 3 weeks prior to your scheduled exam to allow for processing the
    request and mailing exams to proctors. If you are located outside the United
    States, in order to allow adequate time for mailing, please plan to request
    your exam earlier than 3 weeks prior to the exam week.
  </li>
  <li>Contact Student Services if you cannot take a scheduled exam.</li>
</ul>
