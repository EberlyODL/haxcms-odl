<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  This course is a study of the evolution of the major groups of organisms
  including the fundamental concepts of biology. The goal of this course is to
  introduce you to fundamental concepts that are common to all organisms and to
  explore the biological diversity of life on Earth. Biology 110 is intended for
  students who need a majors-level introductory biology course and is not the
  best option for students who are looking for a general education course in
  science.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objective</h2>
<p>
  Biology 110 is a four credit course. The course will utilize web-based
  tutorials and laboratory sessions. The goal of this course is to introduce you
  to fundamental concepts that are common to all organisms and to explore the
  biological diversity of life on Earth.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Course Goals</h2>
<p>
  These are the comprehensive goals for the course. Each tutorial contains
  learning objectives that describe what we expect you to be able to do when you
  understand the material.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Know why water and carbon are essential to life on Earth</li>
  <li>Understand the antiquity of life on Earth and how fossil remains are dated</li>
  <li>Appreciate the diversity of life on Earth, both prokaryotic and
    eukaryotic, identify defining characteristics and evolutionary trends in
    each group</li>
  <li>Recognize the major organelles in a eukaryotic cell and the function(s) of
    each</li>
  <li>Identify the types of cell division that occur in prokaryotic and
    eukaryotic cells and understand the purpose of each type</li>
  <li>Describe how eukaryotic cells transform energy through cellular
    respiration and photosynthesis</li>
  <li>Understand the basic principles of Mendelian genetics and the role of
    meiosis in the inheritance of characters</li>
  <li>Distinguish among the processes of replication, transcription and
    translation, and how each is important in the transmission and expression of
    information encoded in DNA</li>
  <li>Discuss how the genetics of a population is different than that of
    individuals and how the forces of evolution affect the genetic structure of
    populations</li>
  <li>Explain the process of natural selection and the role that it plays in the
    evolution of species</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">General Education Course Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Students will develop key literacies through exposure to scientific
    literature written for the general public as well as peer-reviewed
    literature regarding foundational biological concepts and how these topics
    relate to society.</li>
  <li>Students will develop critical thinking skills by being introduced to the
    role of biological knowledge in their personal lives and society, and by
    analyzing the role of basic biological knowledge and technologies in health
    care, agriculture and industry.</li>
  <li>Students will develop effective communication skills through the
    production of written and oral reports that share scientific knowledge and
    encourage the exchange of ideas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Online Learning</h2>
<p>
  Online learning is not for everyone; some people may not be able to manage a
  course that does not meet face to face to learn. Online learning requires lots
  of planning and self-pacing so that you may be successful in this course.
  Since we will be covering a great deal of material this semester, I highly
  recommend treating this course like a regular lecture course, and keeping up
  with lectures, lab activities, readings and assignments.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Course Communication</h2>
<p>
  In this class our official mode of communication is through the
  “Conversations” function located inside Canvas. All communication between
  student and instructors and between student and student should be respectful
  and professional. It is the student's responsibility to check for course
  communication frequently.
</p>
<p>You can also take advantage of online office hours. There is a link posted in
  Canvas that will connect you to the office hours. You may want to have a
  headset so you can verbally ask questions, but it is also possible to type
  your questions and comments into a text box. Office hours are by appointment.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Course Materials</h2>
<p><strong>Online Lecture Tutorials and practice questions:</strong> The format
  of this course is designed to let you know, on a regular basis, how you are
  progressing through the course (and to let us know how you are doing with the
  material). We will use on-line computer tutorials (accessed through Canvas) to
  guide you through the course.
</p>
<p>
  Each tutorial has a series of practice questions to test your understanding of
  the material and provide you with feedback to help you better understand the
  topics covered. These questions are posted on Canvas. Think carefully before
  you select an answer; these questions are designed to let you know if your
  level of understanding is adequate. These questions are NOT graded; however,
  you should try to answer the questions correctly because your performance on
  the questions is an indication of your understanding of the course material.
</p>
<p><strong>Laboratory Kit:</strong> For this course you will need a customized
  kit that includes all the materials needed to complete the hands-on portion of
  the BIO 110 Laboratory. You can purchase your kit in two ways, and it will
  ship directly to you. </p>

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Late Assignment Policy:</strong> Late assignments will be accepted but
  you will lose 10% of the possible points per day for up to one week after the
  due date. Emergencies do arise, so please contact Dr. Woodward if you
  experience an emergency where you need extra time to complete an assignment.
  Please do not put yourself in danger, such as going out in the dark to find
  internet access to complete an assignment. Each request will be considered on
  an individual basis.
</p>
<p>No extra credit will be offered beyond the existing extra credit assignments
  built into the course (you will receive information about the extra credit
  opportunity later in the course). If you are concerned about your grade,
  please contact Dr. Woodward as quickly as possible and state your concerns.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Assignment of Grades</h2>
<p>
  Lecture material counts for 730 points and lab material counts for 200 points
  for a total of 930 points. If you do not pass lab (your score is less than
