<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course is a study of the evolution of the major groups of organisms
  including the fundamental concepts of biology. The goal of this course is to
  introduce you to fundamental concepts that are common to all organisms and to
  explore the biological diversity of life on Earth. Biology 110 is intended for
  students who need a majors-level introductory biology course and is not the
  best option for students who are looking for a general education course in
  science.
</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
  Biology 110 is a four credit course. The course will utilize web-based
  tutorials and laboratory sessions. The goal of this course is to introduce you
  to fundamental concepts that are common to all organisms and to explore the
  biological diversity of life on Earth.

<h2>Mastering Biology Access</h2>
<p>
  Mastering Biology is an online homework system that will be used extensively
  during the course. Information about registering for Mastering Biology is
  posted on Canvas. Please note: You can purchase an e-book version of the
  textbook through the Mastering Biologywebsite (please see information about
  the optional textbook below).
</p>
<h2>Textbook (Optional)</h2>
<p>
  Textbook - Reece, J et al. 2014. Campbell Biology. Tenth Edition. Pearson
  Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco, CA. The prior edition can also be used. The
  textbook is available in both electronic (etext) and hardcover formats. The
  textbook is not required but some students have found it to be a valuable
  supplement to the online tutorials to the course.
</p>
<h2>Online Labs</h2>
<p>
  Late Nite Labs is an online laboratory software program. Information about
  registering for Late Nite Labs is posted on Canvas.
</p>
<h2>Grade Scale</h2>
<p>
  Lecture material counts for 730 points and lab material counts for 200 points
  for a total of 930 points. If you do not pass lab (your score is less than
  60%), you will not pass the course, regardless of your grade in the lecture
  portion of the class. The grading scale (in points) is:
