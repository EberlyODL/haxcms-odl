<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  MATH 220 is a 2 credit course that teaches the core concepts of matrix
  arithmetic and linear algebra. It is a required course for many students
  majoring in engineering, science, or secondary education. In past coursework,
  students should have gained practice solving pairs of equations like 3 x + 4 y
  = 10, x - y = 1. This is a system of two linear equations with two unknowns
  and as a unique solution students can find by isolating and substituting. In
  linear algebra, this system is represented as A x = b, where x is a vector of
  unknowns, A is a matrix, and b is a vector of constants. Linear algebra is the
  field of mathematics that grew out of a need to solve systems like these and
  related problems with many unknown variables.

  Topics covered in MATH 220 include matrix algebra, vectors, linear
  transformations, solution to systems of linear equations, determinants, matrix
  inverses, concepts of rank and dimension, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and
  others as time permits. Course prerequisites can be filled by one semester of
  calculus. Students may take MATH 220 concurrently with MATH 141, MATH 230, or
  MATH 250. Students seeking a linear algebra course without a calculus
  prerequisite may consider MATH 018 as an alternative. After completing MATH
  220, students can enroll in MATH 441 or MATH 484. MATH 441 provides more
  in-depth perspective on linear algebra. MATH 484 studies widely used
  applications of linear algebra to optimization problems.
