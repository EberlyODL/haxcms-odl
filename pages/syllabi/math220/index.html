<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Course Format</h2>
<p>
  This course is taught completely online. We'll use Penn State's course
  management system CANVAS. You do not need to come to campus at any time. An
  online course is not easier than on-campus course. In fact, it takes a lot
  more self-discipline. You must be willing and able to commit the same amount
  of time as you would for attending class and studying for a traditional
  course. You must also be a motivated, organized student who is comfortable
  working independently.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Recorded Lectures</h2>
<p>
  Recorded lectures on each of the topics covered in the course are available.
  Copies of the slides from the recorded lectures are also available so that
  students may write solutions to the problems as they watch the lectures.
  Filled in copies of the slides are also available.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Electronic Textbook</h2>
<p>
  The electronic text will be primarily used to tie ideas to concepts and skills
  together. The text will be used to provide the student additional detail and
  examples.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Online Homework, Quizzes & Projects</h2>
<p>
  Online homework and quizzes will be due on a weekly basis. Four application
  projects will be due at the times specified on the course outline.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Final Exam (Proctored)</h2>
<p>
  A proctored final exam is included in the course. No notes or calculators will
  be allowed to be used on the final exam.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Grading</h2>
<p>
  Grades will be assigned on the basis of 500 points, distributed as follows:

<p>
  This course may require you to take exams using certain proctoring software
  that uses your computer’s webcam or other technology to monitor and/or record
  your activity during exams. The proctoring software may be listening to you,
  monitoring your computer screen, viewing you and your surroundings, recording
  and storing any and all activity (including visual and audio recordings)
  during the proctoring process. By enrolling in this course, you consent to the
  use of the proctoring software selected by your instructor, including but not
