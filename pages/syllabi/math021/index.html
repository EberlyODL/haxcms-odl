  ) using the course code and instructions found in the Orientation materials.
  The price is approximately $85. This option is much less expensive than buying
  the book and the code separately.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Textbook (Optional)</h2>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Algebraic Skills</h2>
<p>
  Algebraic skills will be primarily developed through work on ALEKS. ALEKS is a
  web-based tutorial system which provides students with ongoing skills based
  assessments and tracks progress. The midterm and final exams will also entail
  skills based problems.
</p>
<p>
  As necessary, lectures will be done via BlackBoard Collaborate. The midterm
  and final exams will administered via Canvas.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">ALEKS</h2>
<p>
  Essentially all of the skills based work will be conducted through ALEKS. The
  ALEKS system will do ongoing assessments of skills based problems and track
  student progress. ALEKS is a major component of the course and a typical
  college algebra student will need to plan on 5-8 hours of online work each
  week (60-90 hours for the course). Skills based points will be earned by
  measuring mastered objective milestones and skills based ALEKS quizzes.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Canvas</h2>
<p>
  The course management system is Canvas. Canvas will be used to deliver, the
  midterm exam and the final exam and associated practice/study exams.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">PIAZZA & BlackBoard Collaborate</h2>
<p>
  Participation in the course is gauged via a student's interaction on Piazza
  and live sessions. Students are expected to ask questions, pose problems and
  answer questions via the Piazza bulletin board.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Grading</h2>
<p>
  The total number of points for the course will be 600 points. Work completed
  in ALEKS, which builds skills, will be worth 230 points. Participation points
  for active participation on the Piazza bulletin board and BlackBoard Live
  sessions is worth 20 points. The last component of the course consists of two
  (2) proctored exams, a midterm exam (150 points) and a comprehensive final
  exam (200 points). The final grade will be determined by the sum of these four
  areas.
