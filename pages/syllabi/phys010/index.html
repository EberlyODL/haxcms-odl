<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  In this class you will learn the conceptual aspects of modern physics with the
  goal of interpreting and summarizing recent technological advances, scientific
  breakthroughs and social events related to science as they appear in the news.
  Real news article will be used in each weekly lesson to introduce the subject.
  The content objectives will focus primarily on the modern physics of quantum
  mechanics and relativity. No prior knowledge of physics is assumed and there
  are not math pre-requisites.
</p>
<p>
  This class is meant to be a fun exploration at the frontier of our knowledge
  of the natural world! Recent scientific news and social events will be our
  guides through the landscape of modern physics.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>On completion of PHYS 010, students will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Identify the relevant physics concepts behind current social, political, and
    economic issues. An understanding of the science behind these issues will
    help you make informed decisions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Draw meaningful conclusions from reading science articles and be able to
    judge the quality of the scientific reporting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Infer ethical issues in scientific research and imagine options for action.
  </li>
  <li>
    Articulate solutions to problems in modern physics in terms of a set of
    concepts and how they apply.
  </li>
  <li>
    Collect and consistently assemble multiple concepts to fully analyze a
    situation (not just get an answer to a specific question) or critique a
    proposed analysis.
  </li>
  <li>
    Draw meaningful conclusions from tables and graphs of data, or from images
    or videos from which data can be obtained.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>
  Physics and Technology for Future Presidents: An Introduction to the Essential
  Physics Every World Leader Needs to Know - By: Richard Muller. (Make sure not
  to buy the pop-science book called “Physics for Future Presidents” by the same
  author). There will be some extra reading material that will be posted on
  Canvas and on the library’s E-reserves.

<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>
  There will be roughly 10 homework throughout the semester. Homework will be
  submitted on Canvas and they aim to test your understanding of the material
  and to work on practice questions similar to what you will find in the
  midterms and final. Doing the homework and making sure to go back to
  understand the questions you missed is one of the best way to do well in
  class!
</p>
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>
  There will be three exams in the semester (two midterms and a final exam)
  where you will have the opportunity to show how well you have learned the
  course material.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam will be delivered through Canvas. There will be a time limit of 50
  minutes for each midterm and 75 minutes for the comprehensive final exam. Only
  one attempt is allowed. You will not need to find a proctor.
</p>
<h2>Project: News Article</h2>
<p>
  You will be expected to complete one project related to class material. This
  will be in the form of a news article on a scientific subject of your choice
  that is related to the concepts discussed in this class. There will be two
  components. In the first part, people will work together to do research and
  produce “index cards” that can then be used to write the news article. Then
  you will individually write a scientific news article on the subject.
</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  Your grade in the course will be based on your performance on the exams,
  quality of the lab work (reports), performance in homework and the quality of
  your project, with the following weight:
