<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The purpose of this course is to provide you with an introduction to atomic
  and molecular structure as well as molecular properties. We will also discuss
  general principles of reactions including stoichiometry and some
  thermodynamics. The long-term goal of this course is to get you to begin
  thinking of chemistry in your everyday life. You should begin noticing that
  chemistry is everywhere: it is in the foods we eat, the ingredients in our
  soaps, and the reason flowers and leaves have specific colors. I encourage you
  to send me anything that you find interesting about chemistry including
  videos, pictures, or websites.

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of the course, students will be able toâ€¦</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define key terms and concepts in chemistry</li>
  <li>
    Explain how atomic and molecular structure relates to macroscopic
    (observable) properties of matter
  </li>
  <li>
    Define the various forms of energy, explain how energy interacts with
    matter, and be able to calculate the energy changes associated with chemical
    and physical processes
  </li>
  <li>
    Apply chemistry concepts to solve mathematical problems on homework, problem
    sets, and exams
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe the chemistry behind phenomena in everyday life (i.e. why water is
    a liquid)
  </li>
</ul>
