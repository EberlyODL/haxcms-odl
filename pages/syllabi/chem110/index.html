<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The purpose of this course is to provide you with an introduction to atomic
  and molecular structure as well as molecular properties. We will also discuss
  general principles of reactions including stoichiometry and some
  thermodynamics. The long-term goal of this course is to get you to begin
  thinking of chemistry in your everyday life. You should begin noticing that
  chemistry is everywhere: it is in the foods we eat, the ingredients in our
  soaps, and the reason flowers and leaves have specific colors. I encourage you
  to send me anything that you find interesting about chemistry including
  videos, pictures, or websites.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>

<h2>Skills Check (~2%)</h2>
<p>
  The skills check is an opportunity to review topics from high school chemistry
  that will be used in CHEM 110. There are two parts to each of the five topics,
  aptly named “Part A” and “Part B.” Each part is a quiz with 5-7 questions and
  a 20-minute time limit. In Part A, you may take the quiz as many times as you
  like. Once you are confident in the skill, you can take Part B up to three
  times. Only the highest score in each part will be recorded. (Everyone can
  earn 100%!!!!) Your average percent score on all 10 quizzes (5 skills, two
  parts each) will be your grade on the skills check. For example, if you earn
  an 80%, you would earn 12 of 15 points.
</p>
<h2>Midterm Exams (~13%)</h2>
<p>
  There will be four (4) 50-minute midterm exams given over the course of the
  semester. Exams will focus on material covered since the last exam; however,
  you are still responsible for information presented previously. If you read
  your lecture notes & the eBook and solve the recommended problems, you will be
  able to anticipate the exam questions; all concepts could make multiple
  appearances. The exams will consist of short answer questions and open-ended
  problems. Some questions may be multiple choice. Stay tuned to announcements
  on the format.
</p>
<h2>Final Exam (~26%)</h2>
<p>
  A cumulative final exam will be given during the week of December 11. The exam
  window will be announced later in the semester. The final exam will be
  proctored remotely just as the midterm exams.
</p>
<h2>Homework Sets (~8%)</h2>
<p>
  There will be 15 graded homework sets (4 points each) throughout the semester.
  One assignment will be due every week. On most occasions homework will be
  graded solely based on completion and effort. On several randomly selected
  occasions, however, one randomly selected problem from the homework assignment
  will be graded for 2 points based on correctness. On those occasions,
  completing the rest of the homework assignment is worth an additional 2
  points, graded based on completeness and effort. Homework sets will be
  available on Canvas and are due by submitting a file in the Canvas assignment
  each Tuesday by 11:59 pm. There will be no late homework accepted. The lowest
  homework score will be dropped at the end of the term.
</p>
<p>
  Other assignments, such as an eBook Scavenger Hunt (7 points on Canvas) will
  be included in this category. If you earn 85% or more of the available
  homework points, you will earn all 60 points in the category! If you earn
  fewer than 85% of the possible points, you will receive a proportionally lower
  score. No extra credit results from accumulating a score of more than 85% of
  the points.
</p>
<h2>Participation (13%)</h2>
<p>
  Participation in class will come in three forms: attending a weekly
  recitation, answering the guiding questions, and interactions in ELMS/Piazza.
  More information on each type of participation is described below.
</p>
<h2>Weekly Recitation</h2>
<p>
  Recitations are one-hour sessions led by a pair of learning assistants via
  Zoom videoconferencing. Recitation is an opportunity to participate actively
  in problem solving and to ask questions about the material. Students will be
  assigned a recitation session according to their availability as indicated by
  a “When is Good” poll (sent to students via email prior to the start of
  classes). There will be 5-7 students in each recitation session. To be
  prepared for recitation, you should bring a copy of the recitation worksheet
  (available on ELMS), a copy of the Periodic Table and datasheet, and a
  scientific calculator. There will be 14 recitations (they will begin in week
  2). If you attend 12 of the 14 sessions, you will earn 4 all 30 points. Each
  absence beyond the first two will result in a three-point (10%) reduction of
  your recitation grade.
</p>
<h2>Guiding Questions</h2>
<p>
  Each week, there will be 2-3 “Guiding Question Sets” meant to assess your
  comprehension of the course content (reading and/or videos). These will be
  available in Canvas (also linked in ELMS) and due each Friday at 11:59 pm. If
  you earn an 85% or higher on the guiding question sets, you will receive all
  40 points available in the category. If you earn fewer than 85% of the
  possible points, you will receive a proportionally lower score. No extra
  credit results from accumulating a score of more than 85% of the points
</p>
<h2>Interactions</h2>
<p>
  Interactions include watching videos, answering embedded h5p questions in
  ELMS, and posting questions or answers to Piazza. Behind-the-scenes click data
  for users can be tracked and will be counted for this portion of the
  participation grade. We will use Piazza as a class forum/chatroom for asking
  and answering questions about the course. You can ask and answer questions
  here, which will be monitored by the TAs, LAs, and instructor. Please direct
  your questions here before e-mailing. You will be able to ask and answer
  anonymously if you wish. The beauty of Piazza is that the entire class can
  benefit from the questions and answers. More information on enrolling and
  etiquette for using will be provided during the semester. Any personal
  inquiries can be addressed by email (see below). If you interact with at least
  85% of the course content in ELMS and make a minimum of five (5) posts to
  Piazza, you will earn all 30 points in the category. If you interact with less
  than 85% of the content, you will receive a proportionally lower score.
</p>
<h2>Extra Credit (~1%)</h2>
<p>
  There will be several opportunities to earn up to a maximum of 8 extra credit
  points over the course of the semester. Opportunities will be announced as
  they come up. The number and type of assignment are at the discretion of the
  instructor.
