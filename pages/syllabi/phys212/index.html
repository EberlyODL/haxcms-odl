<h2>Course Schedule</h2>
<p>
  This is a 4 credit course that is fairly intensive with course work due almost
  every day. A standard week contains three phases: exploratory phase, problem
  solving phase and revision phase. The exploratory phase of a giving week
  overlaps with the revision phase of the previous week. The final assignment
  for a week are due on Tuesday of the next week allowing time to review and
  discuss.

<p>
  Not every week will contain all different types of assignments. For an exam
  week, the exam is on Thursday (on the material of the previous weeks).
</p>
<p>
  Most of the material is posted ahead and it is entirely possible for you to
  adjust this schedule to fit better with your own work/study schedule.
</p>
<h2>Reading Quiz</h2>
<p>
  We will be using an online computer grading system called MasteringPhysics
  (https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/) to do reading quiz . Access to
  MasteringPhysics is provided in the PSU custom book in the bookstore.
