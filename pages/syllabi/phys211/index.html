<h2>Textbook</h2>

  Physics for Scientists and Engineers: A Strategic Approach by Knight, 4th
  edition
</p>
<h2>Course Schedule</h2>
<p>
  This is a 4 credit course that is fairly intensive with course work due almost
  every day. A standard week contains three phases: exploratory phase, problem
  solving phase and revision phase. The exploratory phase of a giving week
  overlaps with the revision phase of the previous week. The final assignment
  for a week are due on Tuesday of the next week allowing time to review and
  discuss.

<p>
  Not every week will contain all different types of assignments. For an exam
  week, the exam is on Thursday (on the material of the previous weeks).
</p>
<p>
  Most of the material is posted ahead and it is entirely possible for you to
  adjust this schedule to fit better with your own work/study schedule.
</p>
<h2>Reading Quiz</h2>
<p>
  We will be using an online computer grading system called MasteringPhysics (<a
    href="https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com"
    target="_blank"
    >https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com</a
  >
  ) to do reading quiz. Access to
  MasteringPhysics is provided in the PSU custom book in the bookstore.
</p>
<p>
  The reading quiz are due early in the week and they are meant to be a first
  learning and practice. Most of the questions are tutorials that will walk you
  through how to solve problems. You get immediate feedback when answering
  questions and many questions provide hints.
</p>
<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>
  Each week, we will have a tutorial. There are three options on how to do the
  tutorials:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Print it and write your answer by hand, take a picture (or a scan) and
    submit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a blank sheet, write your answer by hand clearly numbering them. Take a
    pic or scan and submit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using a tablet, write your answer by hand on the tutorial pdf and submit.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In this type of assignments, we will grade your work and not just your answer.
  If you have a real professional scanner, that will work great. If we have to
  use a phone we recommend to use scanning app which do better than just
  pictures.
</p>
<h2>Labs</h2>
<p>
  The laboratories (8 in total) are designed to provide you with hands-on
  experience with the material being investigated in class as well as teaching
  data sensemaking and observational experimental methods. See the list of
  learning objectives for more details. All of those skills and topics learned
  in the lab may be tested in the exams. The lab will be using the IOLab device
  various sensors together with the accompanying software. While the lab
  component is officially only worth 10% of the grade, a zero on all labs will
  result in a letter grade of D at best irrespective of all other course work.
</p>
<h2>Peer-Review</h2>
<p>
  It is very beneficial for students to see each other works and to receive and
  give feedback. Therefore, a first draft of the weekly tutorial and lab is
  required to be posted every Saturday. You will then be randomly assigned to
  peer-review multiple of your peers and give feedback on their work (not grade
  their work which is only a draft anyway). The instructors will also review
  each draft submission and help out where needed. The tutorial and lab will
  then be resubmitted for grading every Tuesday. The peer-review is graded and
  is part of the quiz grade. As you will see, there are some points every week
  in the quiz assigned to a peer-review question.
</p>
<h2>Discussion boards</h2>
<p>
  Maybe the most important part of this course is the weekly discussion board.
  You will be assigned a team and you will need to post and reply to your
  teammates.
</p>
<p>Often the post will include three parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your answers and reasoning to a couple of conceptual questions on the
    material
  </li>
  <li>Comments/questions on your work on the tutorial</li>
  <li>Comments/questions on your work on the lab</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Instructor and TA will provide feedback in the discussion boards. The
  discussion boards are the online analog of a lecture where the students
  discuss with continuous instructor feedback.
</p>
<p>
  The first post of the discussion is due on Wednesday but replies will continue
  as long as needed.
</p>
<h2>Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  There will be individual quizzes throughout the semester with questions that
  closely resembled the exams. These are graded on correctness. You get two
  tries and the best score is kept. The quiz will also self-reflections
  questions and this is where the points for the peer-review will be attributed.
</p>
<h2>TA Sessions</h2>
<p>
  These are required live discussions once a week where we will review previous
  material and look ahead to the upcoming week. These sessions will be hosted by
  learning assistants, teaching assistant and the instructor. We will have
  multiple time options.
</p>
<h2>Discussions with Professor</h2>
<p>
  The professor will host a discussion hour on Thursdays (not graded or required
  but very useful). These may be recorded but I will need students to start the
  discussions!
</p>
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>
  There will be three midterm exams and a final exam. All midterms are worth the
  same: 15% each for a total of 45%.
</p>
<p>
  Exams will be closed book. Relevant physical constants and formulae will be
  provided. Calculators, cellular phones and other communication devices are NOT
  allowed and the exam will be designed such that they are not needed. The exams
  will be based on the assigned reading in the textbook, the material covered in
  course content, the quizzes, discussion boards and the laboratories/tutorial.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam will be delivered through Canvas. All exams are proctored using
  Examity which allow you to take the exam anywhere and to schedule at any time
  (in the appropriate time window where the exam is opened).
</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  Your grade in the course will be based on your performance in the
  labs/tutorials, on the quizzes, on the discussion boards/wrap-ups/peer-reviews
  and on the exams with the following weights:
