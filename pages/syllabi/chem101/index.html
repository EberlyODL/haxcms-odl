<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  CHEM 101 is an introductory chemistry course that incorporates lectures,
  readings, problem-solving and laboratory experiments in developing an
  understanding of chemical concepts and practices. Prior study of chemistry is
  not assumed, but you should have taken at least one class in algebra before
  taking CHEM 101. For some students, CHEM 101 provides the chemistry required
  by their major area of study. For other students, CHEM 101 provides review and
  preparation for subsequent Chemistry classes such as CHEM 110 (Chemical
  Principles I) and CHEM 202 (Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry).
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>When you successfully complete this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe the structure and behavior of atoms</li>
  <li>Extract data and information from the periodic table of the elements</li>
  <li>
    Predict the properties and behavior of elements based on their position in
    the periodic table
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the process of chemical bonding and predict what type of bonds
    will form between different substances
  </li>
  <li>
    Determine when chemical reactions will take place between substances, the
    ratio in which the substances will combine, what new products will be formed
    in the reaction, and the amount of product formed from a given amount of
    starting materials
  </li>
  <li>
    Correctly name chemical substances based on the ratio of the elements in the
    compound and the type of bonding between the atoms
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify the intramolecular forces that can exist between atoms within a
    chemical compound or molecule and the intermolecular forces that occur
    between molecules
  </li>
  <li>Describe and compare the properties of gases, liquids and solids</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Lesson Assignments (20%)</h2>
<p>
  Each lesson will conclude with a few homework assignments. The format of each
  assignment will vary and may include fill-in-the blank, short essay, and
  multiple choice questions. Each assignment will be due at the end of each
  lesson before beginning the next lesson. The lowest assignment grade will be
  dropped, and all of the others will be weighted equally.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Video Demonstration Summaries (5%)</h2>
<p>
  There will be multiple video demonstrations for some of the lessons. A short
  online submission (one page or less in length) will be required for five of
  the demonstrations. Each submission will go into a separate dropbox and must
  include a description of the demonstration, the concept being presented, your
  observations, and any suggestions you may have to change or expand the
  demonstration. Watch all the videos, but please only submit summaries for 5 of
  the videos.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Lab Experiment Reports (25%)</h2>
<p>
  There will be four lab experiments performed individually by the student. Each
  experiment will have an online report submitted consisting of experimental
  data, observations and short answers to interpretive questions.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Non-Proctored Online Mid-Term Exams (30%)</h2>
<p>
  The two exams will have multiple choice questions. Both will have a 90-minute
  time limit. Only one attempt is allowed. Each exam will be worth 15% of the
  final grade.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Non-Proctored, Closed-Book, Comprehensive Final Exam (20%)</h2>
<p>
  Students will complete a closed-book final exam consisting of multiple-choice
  questions that will be similar in scope to those given in the homework
  assignments and mid-term exams. Students will need to print out the Useful
  Information file located in the Exams folder, which may be used when
  completing the final exam. The file includes a periodic table, a list of key
  equations, and a solubility table.
</p>
<p>
  You will also need a scientific calculator to take the Final Exam. If you want
  to know whether your calculator is allowed, email your instructor as soon as
  possible.
