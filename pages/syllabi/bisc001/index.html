<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  An exploration of how cellular structures and processes contribute to life and
  how life displays unity even in its diversity. Students who have passed BIOL
  027, 110, or 141 may not schedule this course.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this course, a successful student will be able to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>

    including organic compounds and the basic macromolecules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify cell organelles and describe their functions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand basic energy concepts and how enzymes and membranes function.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand cellular respiration and photosynthesis and how they relate to
    each other.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the cell cycle, mitosis, and meiosis and how they differ.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand basic genetics (inheritance, Mendel’s Laws, DNA structure and
    function, gene regulation, DNA technology).
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand basic population genetics and evolution (natural selection,
    genetic variation, gene pools).
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the classification of organisms, taxonomy, and phylogenetics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand how the biological diversity on Earth originated and survey the
    major groups of organisms (prokaryotes, protists, fungi, plants, animals).
  </li>

    Describe some of the issues in medical ethics that have arisen as a result
    of human tissue culture.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>
  You will be expected to check in every day or every other day for any
  announcements or updates. The amount of time spent looking over the material
  typically is correlated with quiz and exam grade: the more time spent studying
  usually translates into a better grade. Although this is an online course, you
  should expect to spend a similar amount of time on the material that you would
  for an in-person class. The general rule for studying is as follows: for every
  one hour of lecture, you should spend 2.5 to 3 hours studying the material.
  That means for a three-credit course, you should spend 7.5 to 9 hours per week
  studying and completing assignments if you intend to do well (“A” or “B”
  level).
</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<h3>Weekly Quizzes</h3>
<p>
  Each week a short quiz (about 15 minutes) will be made available on Canvas,
  covering the material from the previous week’s subject(s). Each quiz will be
  made available starting at 12:01 AM on Monday and will run through 11:59 PM on
  Wednesday. This is designed to ensure that you keep up with your reading and
  study. The quizzes will be in a true/false, matching, or multiple-choice type
  format and are intended to reinforce the main concepts in each chapter. These
  quizzes will only be open for a limited time, so do not go for extended
  periods of time (days, weeks) without having logged into the course. I
  typically do not re-open quizzes unless in the case of technical difficulties
  from my end. If you miss one or a few quizzes, this will not negatively affect
  your grade. If you have taken all 14 quizzes, only your 10 best scores will
  count towards your grade.
</p>
<h3>Book Discussions</h3>
<p>
  Each week, we will have discussions on Canvas about the book The Immortal Life
  of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot. These discussions will consist of one or
  more discussion questions posted by the instructor, which you will respond to
  and discuss. The first response will take place within three days of the
  initial discussion question post and will be at minimum 250 words (longer
  posts are welcome but will not necessarily improve your grade. Quality of post
  and not quantity will determine your score). After everyone has had a chance
  to make an initial response, you will make thoughtful comments on other
  students’ posts on the thread. These comments will be respectful (no name
  calling, threats, trolling, etc.) even if one does not agree with the post in
  question. The normal Penn State guidelines prohibiting harassment and hate
  speech will be in place and will be enforced. We can discuss controversial
  topics like adults because we are adults.
</p>
<h3>Midterm Exam</h3>
<p>
  Approximately every 4 weeks, you will have a midterm exam over the material
  covered. These exams will include true/false, multiple-choice, and/or matching
  questions; in addition there may be diagrams to label and/or short
  free-response questions. Exams will cover material for each “unit”: Exam 1
  will cover material from the beginning of the course until the first exam,
  Exam 2 will cover material after Exam 1 until the second exam, and so forth.
  These will be delivered online, but they will be proctored using Examiny
  software. You will have a window of about 72 hours to take your exam, but you
  must schedule it in advance through the Examiny tab in Canvas. If you make
  changes to your scheduled exam time less than 24 hours before the start of the
  exam window, Examiny will charge you a fee of $3.
</p>
<h3>Final Exam</h3>
<p>
  The final will be similar in format to the midterm exams. The only differences
  will be that the final will be slightly (about 50%) longer, and will be
  cumulative . The cumulative section will be about 33% of the final, and the
  remainder will be material covered after the third midterm. The final should
  be scheduled during Finals Week.
