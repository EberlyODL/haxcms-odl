<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  CHEM 810 is the first in a sequence of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
  (LC-MS) courses designed to fill an industry need to provide high-quality
  instruction in LC theory and application. The course topics include the
  background and history of chromatography; fundamental concepts in
  chromatographic separations; basic instrumentation; column, particle and phase
  chemistry; and basic method development. The course material is designed to
  increase student understanding of both the analytical instrument used in the
  laboratory and the principles underlying the measurements. The course
  specifically caters to the needs of the analytical chemical industry and
  individuals newly hired into introductory sample management/preparation and
  quality assurance/quality control positions within companies using liquid
  chromatographic techniques.
</p>
<p>
  There is no required textbook. The bulk of the course uses algebra to solve
  sets of equations. You should feel comfortable doing this and capable of doing
  this in a timely manner. You will also use Microsoft Excel for a number of
  assignments. You should feel comfortable preparing spreadsheets, preparing
  plots, and adding trendlines. If you do not feel confident in these areas talk
  with the instructor early in the semester so you can acquire some proficiency.
  Don’t fall behind. Later material in this course depends strongly on earlier
  material and procrastination can quickly lead to a difficult situation. You
  should set aside regular times during the week for focused study.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>After successfully completing this course, the student will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Identify the factors (and associated equations) which influence the
    efficiency and resolution of a chromatographic separation and be able to
    quantify these contributions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify which factors influence column performance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify the chemical interactions (intermolecular forces) which give rise
    to analyte separation and use this knowledge to develop isocratic or
    gradient-based elution methods.
  </li>
  <li>
    Evaluate the instrumental contributions (extra-column) to the resolution and
    efficiency of chromatographic separations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify and describe the function of each component of an HPLC system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Design an SPE sample pretreatment method appropriate for the analyte(s) of
    interest.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Discussions</h2>
<p>
  The first activity is to engage in a class discussion related to that week’s
  assigned problems – questions concerning clarification, problem-solving
  strategies, and placing the questions into a broader context (when/how/why
  might such a problem be useful in the practical application of LC). You must
  post an initial response to any one or all assigned problems by 11:59 PM
  Wednesday of each week. You will then respond to at least two of your
  colleagues during the week. You must post your initial response before you are
  able to respond to others. Even though it is due on Wednesday at the latest,
  the earlier you can post your initial response during the week offers everyone
  a greater opportunity to respond to others. As with any academic work,
  procrastination makes the process more difficult in the long run. Responses to
  your peers, along with your answers to the assigned problems, are due no later
  than 11:59 PM Sunday each week.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Grading</h2>
<p>
  The course website provides numerous example problems with detailed
  instructor-guided solutions and practice problems for which answer keys are
  provided once an initial answer attempt is submitted. No grade is assigned to
  the instructor-guided example problems or the practice problems.
</p>
<p>
  Each week, a set of 5-10 proficiency- and mastery-level questions associated
  with each module will be assigned. Students are encouraged to discuss the
  questions with each other and the instructor (see Course Schedule above) prior
  to submitting their answers. Answer keys are not provided.
</p>
<p>
  There are a total of 4 exams, one at the end of each module. Each exam is
  comprehensive in scope. A minimum score of 70% is required on an end-of-module
  exam before a student is eligible to access the subsequent module (e.g.., a
  score of 70% is required on Exam 1 – the exam at the end of Module 1 – before
  a student is permitted access to the material in Module 2).
</p>
<p>
  In fairness to the instructor who must grade the required course work, and to
  the other students, late work will not be accepted. Think about this. A
  substantial number of late or missing work will affect your grade. Stay caught
  up.
