<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  This course combines Genetics, Human Genetics, Evolution and Ecology. It is an
  introductory course for non-science majors, and it is hoped that you will
  develop a basic understanding of genetic and biological terms and their
  importance to our technologically advanced society. Evolution is a central
  theme of biology and it helps us to understand the process of life that is
  ongoing all across our globe. The interactions among members of that global
  community provide the backdrop for understanding the ecology of our planet and
  our place in that community. There are no prerequisites for this course.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Assignments</h2>
<p>
  All students are expected to complete the weekly quizzes on time. These will
  be available for at least one week so budget your time accordingly. You are
  not able to take all of your tests at one time and be done. This course is
  paced so you can progress through at a reasonable speed.
</p>
<p>
  Each week there will be at least one lesson for you to study. Each lesson will
  have one quiz, one homework assignment, and textbook assignment (LearnSmart
  modules, Labs, etc.). Be aware that some weeks there may be more than one
  lesson, thus more than one quiz and homework/textbook assignments. Each of
  these have specific due dates listed on the folder in which you find them.
</p>
<p>
  You may complete the homework and textbook assignments early as they will be
  available from the start of the semester. However, each quiz has a definite
  shelf life. Quizzes are meant to activate on a Saturday and deactivate on the
  following Sunday. That means you have more than a week to complete it. At no
  other time will you be able to view or complete quizzes, it is impossible to
  open up the quiz for a single person. The only exception to this is an
  instance of the quiz being improperly configured. If I short the class on time
  due an incorrect setting I will open up the quiz for additional time and
  everyone will have an opportunity to then complete it. However, that has been
  a rare event (but if it happens, notify the instructor). Pay attention to due
  dates, each assignment has one listed with the folder for that week.
</p>
<p>
  The quizzes are set to overlap so you can manage your schedule if you happen
  to be away from a computer for an entire weekend. If you know that will happen
  then either get things out of the way very early or make it a point to finish
  the following weekend. Missing an assignment should never happen if you manage
  your time properly. You will be entirely responsible for your time and
  scheduling.
</p>
<p>
  The weekly quizzes will be timed so it will not be possible to look up the
  answers to these questions at your leisure. The expectation is that you will
  study the content, gain some level of mastery of the terminology and take the
  tests to see how well you know everything. You are not to have access to
  sources of information when you take these tests, they are not open book.
</p>
<p>
  The homework assignments may be completed ahead of schedule but not after the
  due date. Being late a day or two will result in a late penalty. Homework
  turned in after that will result in a zero. Homework assignments should not be
  copied from any other source, cited correctly or not. Many assignments will
  have you finding information from sources including the internet, however, a
  cut and paste job does not equal effort. Googling information is not
  considered an academic achievement.
</p>
<p>
  Everything you write is expected to be your own work, not something you find
  and copy from the internet. It's perfectly clear when students have
  plagiarized a paragraph from a web page. It only takes 30 minutes to find a
  few web sites about a topic and then write up a summary of what you find.
  Don't risk University sanctions and an F for a homework assignment that should
  take less than an hour. See the statement on academic integrity for further
  information.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Late Assignments / Technical Difficulites</h2>
<p>
  Since you have seven days in which to submit homework, and take a quiz, I will
  not accept illness or technical difficulties as an excuse to make up missed
  work. The only exception to this would be an extended hospitalization stay.
  All quizzes and homework message boards are available at the beginning of of
  the course. The due dates listed with each assignment are the last days that a
  quiz or homework assignment is available. To avoid missing deadlines, submit
  your work early and avoid waiting until the last evening at 11:55 pm to submit
  your homework or take a quiz. Your internet dropping out at the last possible
  minute to submit work is not a reasonable cause for being unable to complete
  work in a timely manner. Do not turn in work at the last possible minute. No
  scores will be dropped. Work cannot be turned in for a higher grade once a
  grade is assigned. There will be no opportunities to turn in extra work for
  extra credit. Be prepared to do the necessary work to reach your goals for a
  final grade.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Submitting Your Work</h2>
<p>
  All course work will be submitted to your instructor through Canvas. To do
  this, you will need to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Click on the Modules button in the menu bar at the left of this page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose the folder for the week we are currently in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click on the homework assignment for the week.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type your answer into the text box
  </li>
  <li>
    Click "submit assignment"
  </li>
  <li>
    At the appropriate time click on the quiz for that week and complete it
    within the time specified or it will automatically submit whether you are
    finished or not.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Grading</h2>
<p>
  The Grading Scale can be found in the Getting Started section of Canvas. All
  grades can be found in Canvas by going to the Grades button on the left hand
  side.
</p>
<p>
  Each lesson has a quiz that will vary in length between 10 and 20 points each.
  Some will be longer than others depending on the amount of material covered in
  a particular lesson.
</p>
<p>
  Each quiz question is worth 1 point out of the total. Every question is worth
  exactly the same as any other question; only the length of the quiz each week
  will vary. Do not think in terms of percentage points here, this will be a
  point system based on total points.
</p>
<p>
  Students will work on these assignments as an individual and will be
  responsible for completing them on time. Late assignments will have a
  deduction, assignments more than a couple of days late will not be accepted.
  Once we reach the end of the course it will not be possible to go back and
  complete work that is outdated by weeks or even months. Keep up on assignments
  to gain maximum points.
</p>
<p>
  Grades are based on a combination of quizzes where each question is worth one
  point and various homework assignments worth a handful of points. All students
  are expected to complete the weekly quizzes on time. These will be available
  for at least one week so budget your time accordingly. You are not able to
  take all your tests at one time and be done. This course is paced so you can
  progress through at a reasonable speed.Each homework assignment has a specific
  number of points associated with it.
</p>
<p>
  Any questions concerning a particular quiz or homework assignment must be
  resolved immediately. You cannot wait till the end of the semester to correct
  any problems. Due to time constraints, it will be impossible to review all
  assignments on the last day in the hope of finding one or two points to meet a
  grade cutoff. You should ask that all grading issues be resolved as they occur
  during the semester. No exams will be dropped; no extra credit will be
  accepted. It's impossible to evaluate hundreds of book reports or shoebox
  dioramas.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Deferred Grades</h2>
<p>
  Students who are unable to complete the course because of illness or emergency
  may be granted a deferred grade which will allow the student to complete the
  course within the first six weeks of the following semester.
</p>
<p>
  When a request for a deferred grade is supported by the instructor, the
  instructor indicates this approval by recording the deferred grade symbol (DF)
  for the student. The expiration date for the deferred grade is automatically
  recorded as the end of the sixth week of the next semester. Spring semester
  approvals expire during the fall semester unless the student enrolls during
  summer session. Therefore, course requirements must be completed and a grade
  must be submitted by the end of six weeks into the studentâ€™s next semester for
  which he or she is registered. Any deferred grade that is not replaced by the
  deadline will automatically become an F.
</p>
<p>
  Note that deferred grades are limited to those students who can verify and
  document a valid reason for not being able to complete the last few
  assignments, not for gaining extra time to complete missing work from earlier
  in the semester. Students are expected to have completed at least 75% of the
  course assignments to be eligible for a deferment. For more information see DF
  grade.
