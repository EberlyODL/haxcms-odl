<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  This course will provide students the mathematical background and quantitative
  skills in various mathematical applications in such areas which are related to
  voting, fair divisions which includes apportionment methods, and the
  understanding and application of basic graph theory such as Euler and Hamilton
  circuits. This course may be used by students from non-technical majors to
  satisfy 3 credits of their General Education Quantification (GQ) requirement.
  This course does not serve as a prerequisite for any mathematics courses and
  should be treated as a terminal course.

<p>
  Watch assigned mini lecture videos and attend a weekly lecture (or review the
  recorded session). Suggested problems will be assigned but will not be
  submitted. Most weeks will also have a specific assignment which is due. These
  "specific assignments" will vary depending upon the curriculum material of the
  week.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Exams</h2>
<p>
  A midterm exam follows each of the three units. The midterms associated with
  Unit 1 and Unit 3 are NOT proctored, however they are timed exams and will be
  done via Canvas. The second midterm and final exam will be more comprehensive
  and are proctored exams. These will also be donve via Canvas assessment, but
  your secured proctor will need to provide the password to unlock the exam.
