<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course will provide students the mathematical background and quantitative
  skills in various mathematical applications in such areas which are related to
  voting, fair divisions which includes apportionment methods, and the
  understanding and application of basic graph theory such as Euler and Hamilton
  circuits. This course may be used by students from non-technical majors to
  satisfy 3 credits of their General Education Quantification (GQ) requirement.
  This course does not serve as a prerequisite for any mathematics courses and
  should be treated as a terminal course.
