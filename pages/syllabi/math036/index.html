<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course will provide students the mathematical background and quantitative
  skills in various mathematical applications in such areas which are related to
  voting, fair divisions which includes apportionment methods, and the
  understanding and application of basic graph theory such as Euler and Hamilton
  circuits. This course may be used by students from non-technical majors to
  satisfy 3 credits of their General Education Quantification (GQ) requirement.
  This course does not serve as a prerequisite for any mathematics courses and
  should be treated as a terminal course.

<h2>Weekly Work</h2>
<p>
  Watch assigned mini lecture videos and attend a weely lecture (or review the
  recorded session). Suggested problems will be assigned, but will not be
  submitted. Most weeks will also have a specific assignement which is due.
  These "specific assignements" will vary depending upon the curriculum material
  of the week.
</p>
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>
  A midterm exam follows each of the three units. The midterms associated with
  Unit 1 and Unit 3 are NOT proctored, however they are timed exams and will be
  done via Canvas. The second midterm and final exam will be more comprehensive
  and are proctored exams. These will also be donve via Canvas assessment, but
  your secured proctor will need to provide the password to unlock the exam.

<h2>Arranging a Proctor</h2>
<p>
  You will need to secure a proctor in order to take exams in this course. A
  proctor will not automatically be assigned to you; rather, you must make the
  necessary contacts to secure a professional who will serve in this capacity.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Contact a person who meets the qualifications and ask him or her to proctor
    your exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    Student Services must approve your proctor before any exams can be taken.
    Please see instructions for securing a
    <a
      href="https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/courses/proctored-exams"
      target="_blank"
      >suitable proctor</a
    >
    . While many proctors will serve on a voluntary basis, you are responsible
    for paying any expenses incurred in retaining a proctor.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must complete a Proctor Information Form and submit the completed form
    with the proctor verification documentation. Note: If your proctor has been
    previously approved by the World Campus during a prior course within two
    years, you do not need to obtain verification. World Campus retains proctor
    information on file for two years.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your proctor does not meet the required specifications, Student Services
    will notify you within 5 to 7 business days.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will need to complete an Exam Request Form for each exam. Contact your
    proctor to confirm the date, time, and location of your exam(s). Complete
    the form 3 weeks prior to your scheduled exam to allow for processing the
    request and mailing exams to proctors. If you are located outside the United
    States, in order to allow adequate time for mailing, please plan to request
    your exam earlier than 3 weeks prior to the exam week.
  </li>
  <li>Contact Student Services if you cannot take a scheduled exam.</li>
</ul>
