<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course is an introductory survey course of Microbiology. This course
  serves as a gateway to a whole host of different disciplines in the field of
  Microbiology. In addition to the basic science of living things and microbes
  in particular the course also includes an exploration of Metabolism, Genetics,
  Immunology, Epidemiology, Virology, and Biotechnology. Each of these areas are
  covered by other entire courses or even academic majors but we will focus on
  the basics of each as well as other topics related to microbes and disease.
</p>
<p>
  This course will involve the study of a weekly lesson or two followed by the
  completion of a weekly quiz and homework assignment. We will also be using the
  Penn State Canvas system for course communications and grading. Continue on to
  read the rest of the course information including the syllabus and course
  policies.

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  The grades in this class will be based on 400 points. Each lesson we will
  cover this semester has a quiz that will vary in length between 15 and 30
  points each. Some will be longer than others depending on the amount of
  material covered in a particular lesson.
</p>
<p>
  However, each quiz question is worth 1 point out of the 400 total. Every
  question is worth exactly the same as any other question, only the length of
  the quiz each week will vary. Do not think in terms of percentage points here,
  this will be a point system based on 400 total points.
</p>
<p>
  Students will work on these assignments as an individual and will be
  responsible for completing them on time. Late assignments will have a
  deduction, assignments more than a couple of days late will not be accepted.
  Once we reach the end of the course it will not be possible to go back and
  complete work that is outdated by weeks or even months. Keep up on assignments
  to gain maximum points.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Grades are based on a combination of quizzes where each question is worth
    one point and various homework assignments worth a handful of points. Each
    homework assignment has a specific number of points associated with it.
  </li>
  <li>
    All students are expected to complete the weekly quizzes on time. These will
    be available for at least one week so budget your time accordingly. You are
    not able to take all your tests at one time and be done. This course is
    paced so you can progress through at a reasonable speed.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Any questions concerning a particular quiz or homework assignment must be
  resolved right away. You cannot wait till the end of the semester to correct
  any problems. Due to time constraints it will be impossible to review all
  assignments on the last day in the hope of finding one or two points to meet a
  grade cutoff. You should ask that all grading issues be resolved as they occur
  during the semester. No exams will be dropped; no extra credit will be
  accepted. It's impossible to evaluate dozens of book reports or shoebox
  dioramas.
