<h2>Laboratory Investigations (75%)</h2>
<p>
  Each week, there will be an investigation to complete. All of the information
  will be provided on LabArchives. The first two weeks are considered a “dry”
  lab because there will not be an explicit experiment conducted. Most
  laboratory investigations will be worth 70 points and consist of three parts:
  notebook pages, post-lab worksheet, and a quiz. Each part is explained in more
  detail below. The deadline to submit all parts of the investigation for the
  week will be on Tuesday of the following week.
</p>
<h2>Notebook Pages (10 points)</h2>
<p>
  There will be a dedicated page in LabArchives for collecting raw data and
  recording procedural notes.
</p>
<h2>Post-lab Worksheet (50 points)</h2>
<p>
  After completing the investigation and collecting the data, you will complete
  a worksheet where you will analyze the data. Analysis may consist of
  performing calculations with the data, making graphs, and assessing accuracy
  and/or precision of results.
</p>
<h2>Quiz (10 points)</h2>
<p>
  The quiz associated with each laboratory investigation can be completed at
  anytime during the week on Canvas. You will have 20-mintues and up to two
  attempts (only the highest score will be kept). The quizzes will test your
  conceptual understanding of the investigation.
</p>
<p>
  All parts of the lab investigations will be due on Tuesdays by 11:59 pm and
  should be handed in on time. If they are not handed in on time, substantial
  penalties will apply (–10% for each day that an assignment is late). Material
  that is more than one week late will not be accepted.
</p>
<h2>Midterm Exams (10% each)</h2>
<p>
  There will be two (2) midterm exams given over the course of the semester.
  Exams are schedule on the following dates and times and will require you to
  come to campus. If you are not able to make the exam at that time, you must
  make arrangements with instructor for an alternate exam time earlier in the
  day.
</p>
<p>
  Exams will focus on material covered since the last exam; however, you are
  still responsible for information presented previously. The exams will consist
  of short answer questions and open-ended problems. Some questions may be
  multiple choice. Stay tuned to announcements for details on the format.
</p>
<h2>Participation (5%)</h2>
<p>
  We will have a class forum/chatroom for asking and answering questions about
  the course using Piazza (accessed in Canvas). You can ask and answer questions
  here, which will be monitored by the TA and instructor. Please direct your
  questions here before e-mailing. You will be able to ask and answer
  anonymously if you wish. The beauty of Piazza is that the entire class can
  benefit from the questions and answers. More information on enrolling and
  etiquette for using will be provided during the semester. You must make 10
  posts (questions or answers) anytime before October 19 to earn all 25
  participation points for the exam period. You will earn a proportionately
  lower score for fewer than 10 posts. Make an addition 10 posts (questions or
  answers) anytime between October 20 and December 7 to earn the remaining 25
  points.
</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  The final grade is calculated based on scores in each assignment category
  (details follow).

<h2>Make-up Exams</h2>
<p>
  As required by University regulations, students who miss an exam with a valid
  excuse (family emergency, illness, university-scheduled activities, etc.) will
  be given an opportunity to make-up the exam. Prearranged make ups can be taken
  earlier in the exam week. In order to be eligible for the make-up exam ALL of
  the following conditions MUST be fulfilled:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The missed exam is the result of a University-approved excuse. Per Senate
    Policy 42-27, “Requests for missing class or an evaluative event due to
    reasons that are based on false claims may be considered violations of the
    policy on Academic Integrity”
  </li>
  <li>
    Instructor must be notified in writing (email is preferred) within 24 hours
    of the missed exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must schedule a make up for the exam within 1 week of the original exam
    date.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Regrades and Grade Corrections</h2>
<p>
  If after an exam or laboratory investigation is returned there is a question
  concerning the grading of the assignment, the material should be resubmitted
  to instructor for full reconsideration. Under no circumstances will anyone
  else make changes to the grades. All requests for re-grading are to be made in
  writing according to the procedure outlined below and must be submitted to
  instructor within one week of receiving the feedback. Note that the entire
  assignment will be regraded and this may result in a lower grade. Late
  re-grades will not be accepted and will not be considered at the end of the
  semester.
</p>
<p>
  The written request for a re-grade must be on a separate piece of paper. DO
  NOT ALTER THE ORIGINAL SUBMISSION. The re-grade must include an explanation as
  to why you feel the problem should be re-graded. I will not discuss with you
  whether or not you should submit a re-grade. "Brief comparisons" which consist
  of "I think I deserve more points" or “the answer is correct because my friend
  had the same answer” are NOT reconsidered.
</p>
<p>
  Note: Addition errors made during point totaling are not considered re-grades
  and may be given to the instructor for correction at any time during the
  semester.
</p>
