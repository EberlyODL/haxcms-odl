<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course is a one-semester college level introductory chemistry course
  covering the fundamental principles of general, organic, and biochemistry.
  Three credits, fulfills the General Education (GN) requirements.
</p>
<p>
  Course topics include dimensional analysis, atomic structure and periodicity,
  chemical bonding, molecular structure, states of matter and intermolecular
  forces, basic gas laws, solutions and solubility, acids, bases and
  equilibrium, reaction stoichiometry and thermodynamics. In addition,
  fundamentals of organic nomenclature, properties of main organic functional
  groups, and structure and function of biological macromolecules will be
  discussed. The course will emphasize chemistry in environmental and
  health-related contexts.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
  The overall objective of this course is for students to gain knowledge of
  fundamental principles in the areas of general chemistry, organic chemistry,
  and biochemistry. Since many of the students enrolled in this course will be
  majoring in environmental or health related sciences, this course will
  emphasize chemistry as it appears in environmental and health related
  contexts. The specific learning objectives are listed below:

    in scientific notation and provides log/antilog functions). Calculators with
    text-storage, graphing, or communication capabilities (such as the TI-81

<h2>Midterm / Final Exams</h2>
<p>
  There will be three midterm examinations during the semester and a
  comprehensive final examination during the final exam period. Each exam will
  be administered through a proctoring service called Examity® (more information
  below). Dates and times for midterm exams are flexible; you may sign up to
  take each exam on either Thursday, Friday, or Saturday of each exam week.
</p>
<h2>Make-up Exam</h2>
<p>
  A student having a legitimate excuse for missing any of the three scheduled
  midterms will be provided with a single make-up exam. This cumulative make-up
  exam will cover the material from all three midterms. It is your
  responsibility to obtain permission from your instructor to take this exam.
  The make-up exam will be provided only to students with valid excuses (family
  emergency, illness, university-scheduled activities, etc.).
</p>
<h2>Lectures and Course Content</h2>
<p>
  Most course content is delivered in the form of weekly lessons. Each week you
  will have two lessons to complete (or one lesson on exam weeks). These lessons
  are available on Canvas and consist of a series of lecture videos that are
  accompanied by written lecture notes. After viewing these materials you’ll be
  asked to complete a Knowledge Check Quiz that is based on the lesso
</p>
<p>
  Three versions of the lecture slides are provided with each lesson. “Slides
  without solutions” are lecture slides without any solutions to
  example/practice problems; you’re encouraged to take notes using this version
  of the slides. A copy of the slides with solutions is also provided. The third
  version of the lecture slides contains written notes below each slide
  explaining the content from that slide.
</p>
<h2>Knowledge Check Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  After finishing each lesson you’ll be asked to complete a Knowledge Check
  Quiz. You’ll receive three attempts on each quiz, and only your highest score
  will count. The quiz questions will change from one attempt to the next.
  You’re encouraged to ask for help if you have questions about the quiz
  questions; posting your questions on Piazza is encouraged
</p>
<p>
  Knowledge Check Quizzes are due on Sunday of each week. Knowledge Check
  Quizzes will open two weeks before they are due. The Knowledge Check Quizzes
  account for 13% of the total course grade. At the end of the semester your two
  lowest Knowledge Check scores will be dropped.
</p>
<h2>Homework Assignments</h2>
<p>
  Homework is designed to help you develop basic skills and understand and apply
  your understanding of concepts presented in class. Doing all assigned problems
  is essential to success in this course. Homework assignments can be accessed
  from the Canvas page. You’re encouraged to work with your peers on homework
  assignments, and you’re welcome to ask for help on Piazza, but your submitted
  work must be your own. Homework is due at 11:59pm each Wednesday and should be
  submitted on our Canvas page as a scanned PDF or DOCX file. There are no
  homework assignments in the weeks following exams.
</p>
<p>
  Each homework assignment is scored out of 10 possible points (not equivalent
  to course points). On some occasions homework will be graded solely based on
  completion and effort. On other occasions, however, one randomly selected
  problem from the homework assignment will be graded for 5 points based on
  correctness. On those occasions, completing the rest of the homework
  assignment is worth an additional 5 points, graded based on completeness and
  effort.
</p>
<p>
  The homework scores will be totaled twice during the semester (after exam 2
  and at the end of the semester). You must earn at least 75% of the available
  homework points during each period to earn full course points for that period.
  No extra credit results from accumulating more than 75% of the points during
  that period. There will be no make-up opportunities for homework due to the
  built-in excess of points.
</p>
<p>
  All homework assignments will be submitted electronically using the
  appropriate Canvas page. In order to upload your work you’ll need to either
  scan it or take a high quality photograph of it (we suggest taking a photo
  with a phone). You may be asked to resubmit your assignment if the image
  quality of your scanned work is insufficient. You must upload your work as a
  single PDF or DOCX file in order for Canvas to accept it. One way to do this
  is to use an Android or iOS app that saves photographs on your phone as PDF
  files. You can find many such apps by searching for scanning apps on the
  Google Play Store or Apple App Store. “CamScanner” is a popular app that was
  used by students in previous semesters. Alternatively, you can copy and paste
  an image of your homework into a Microsoft Word document and save it as a DOCX
  file.
