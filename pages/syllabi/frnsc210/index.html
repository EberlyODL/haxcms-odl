<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  The primary aim of this course is to prepare students for entry into the
  undergraduate forensic science program and to enhance success in the 400 level
  forensic science courses. This course is designed to introduce students to
  several fundamental areas and provide the theory and knowledge essential for
  success in the ﬁeld. The associated skills and abilities for these practices
  will be developed in later courses required for the forensic science program.
</p>
<p>
  Presently, forensic science and criminalistics are primarily specialized;
  forensic biologists, forensic chemists, trace evidence examiners, latent print
  specialists, ﬁrearm and tool mark examiners, etc. While some criminalists may
  be cross-trained in other areas, the majority practice solely in a speciﬁc
  sub-discipline. Regardless of the specialty, all criminalists and forensic
  scientists will be exposed to and required to perform many of the same
  essential practices. All criminalists will record observations, in the ﬁeld
  and in the laboratory, as case notes. They will prepare sketches, take and
  record measurements, and photograph scenes and/or physical evidence.
  Microscopes are used in nearly every sub-discipline for the examination of
  physical evidence. Criminalists are expected to report and testify to their
  examinations, analyses, results, and conclusions.
</p>
<p>
  This course is designed to introduce students to these fundamental areas and
  provide the theory and knowledge essential for success in the ﬁeld. The
  associated skills and abilities for these practices will be developed in later
  courses. FRNSC 210 provides a ﬁrm foundation for all later courses; it is the
  cornerstone of your education and will serve you well as a criminalist. This
  knowledge cannot be forgotten upon completion of this course; it must be
  retained as it comprises the essential practices required of all criminalists
  and forensic scientists.
