<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  This course seeks to approximate the lab experience a student would have in a
  physical laboratory setting on a college campus. While it is not possible to
  provide students with a hands on lab experience for most activities, the
  essential learning process remains the same. This course will emphasize the
  learning and problem solving skills acquired in any laboratory course at the
  expense of tactile handling of materials. In some ways this will be an
  advantage as this experience will allow for lab activities that would not
  normally be possible in an introductory course. Students will learn about and
  "handle" pathogenic organisms and laboratory equipment not normally seen
  outside of advanced microbiology labs.
</p>
<p>
  Each week students will complete laboratory activities using state of the art
  simulation technology that is web based so having good access to the internet
  is necessary. Students will learn microbiology concepts and terminology,
  engage in various learning activities and take weekly quizzes.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, the student will have learned:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to handle, culture, observe and classify microbes</li>
  <li>
    How to quantify, identfy and classify microbes isolated from diverse sources
  </li>
  <li>How environmental factors influence microbial growth</li>
  <li>How to control/prevent microbial growth</li>
  <li>
    How to isolate and characterize medically important microbes from the human
    body
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Course Format</h2>
<p>
  Each lab section will administered by a Teaching Assistant (TA). All issues
  pertaining to the course should be handled directly with your TA. In the
  highly unlikely event of difficulties, do not hesitate to contact the Course
  Coordinator. Your TA is responible for grading all quizzes, exams, practicums,
  etc. However, final letter grades will be assigned by the Coordiator.
</p>
<p>
  All course material will be posted on Canvas. Thus, you are required to print
  and bring this material to class. At the beginning of each lab, your
  instructor will provide some background information for each of the exercises.
  Nevertheless, it will serve you well to read and understand the material
  posted on Canvas for prior to arriving for lab.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Lab Reports / Questions</h2>
<p>
  Each lab exercise includes a lab report with questions that should be
  completed and handed in to your TA on the required day (your TA will inform
  you of this). If you do not hand in your lab reports on the required day, the
  following penalties will be applied:
</p>
<p>
  Two/thirds of your points will be deducted for each incomplete lab reportYou
  will be awarded 0 points for each late submission
</p>
<p>You must hand this material directly to your instructor.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Several TA-designed quizzes will be administered over the course of the
  semester. The quizzes will be based on information from the course web site
  and the introduction given by the TA at the beginning of each class. The quiz
  will also include content derived from lab procedures and results of
  experiments
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Practicum</h2>
<p>
  This will involve demonstrating your proficiency in a few common laboratory
  procedures. These include performing the Gram stain, streaking agar plates to
  isolate single colonies, demonstrating the aseptic transfer of microbial
  cultures, and problems sets that focus on making dilutions. You will have many
  opportunities during the lab periods to practice these procedures throughout
  the semester.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Instructor Evaluation</h2>
<p>
  Your general performance and behavior in class will be evaluated by your TA.
  This evaluation will be based on the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arriving on time</li>
  <li>Following safety rules</li>
  <li>Following the directions of the TA</li>
  <li>
    Keeping your work area clean - points will be deducted each time a TA has to
    clean up your work space at the end of the period
  </li>
  <li>Taking care of equipment</li>
  <li>
    Paying attention to all directions given in the procedures and by the TA -
    don't make your TA’s constantly repeat themselves by not paying attention
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Attendance</h2>
<p>
  Since this is a laboratory class, attendance is mandatory. Due the fact that
  we will be working with microbial cultures of limited lifespan, we do not have
  the resources to provide make up labs. Moreover, since many of the exercises
  involve working in pairs, your absence will negatively impact your partner.
</p>
<p>
  Unexcused absences are not permitted and will result in a loss of 2% of your
  final grade.
</p>
<p>
  f you have a legitimate reason to miss class (an illness or a death in the
  family), you will be required to bring supporting documentation and you must
  inform your TA by email (or the next lab period at the latest) to explain the
  reason for your absence.
</p>
<p>
  If you miss more than 5 classes for whatever reason, you should consider
  dropping the course or you will be awarded an F: in a laboratory course, we
  cannot assign a grade unless you complete the required exercises.
