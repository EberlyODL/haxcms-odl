<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This is a course in abstract linear algebra, focusing on finite-dimensional
  vector spaces over the real and complex numbers and linear operators which act
  on them. Topics include eigenvalues and eigenvectors, inner product spaces,
  the spectral theorem, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, and Jordan canonical form.
  Successful students will learn to give proofs of abstract statements in linear
  algebra and use the abstract theory to analyze particular examples.
</p>
<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
<p>
  Math 311W, Concepts of Discrete Mathematics. Former experience with
  computational linear algebra such as Math 220 will be helpful but is not
  strictly necessary.

<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>
  Sheldon Axler, Linear Algebra Done Right, 3rd edition. With your Penn State
  account you can get an eBook version for free

  . However, the book is not exorbitantly expensive, and you should be reading
  it very carefully. I would strongly consider purchasing the hard copy. The
  free electronic textbook "Linear Algebra" by Jim Heffron may also be helpful,
  get it

<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>
  Homework is by far the most important part of the course. The only way to
  learn advanced mathematics is to do advanced mathematics. Weekly homework
  assignments will be posted on the webpage most Wednesdays, and they are due in
  class the following Wednesday. A typical homework set will consist of a
  reading assignment, 5 exercises to be turned in, and a list of additional
  textbook exercises that you should complete for yourself. Please write your
  solutions clearly and carefully, using complete sentences to explain all steps
  of your proofs or computations.
</p>
<p>
  If you have to miss class on the due date, you can turn in your assignment
  early to my box in the McAllister building. Solutions to homework will be
  posted after class on the day it is due, so late homework will not be accepted
  for any reason. Your lowest score will be dropped at the end of the semester.
</p>
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>
  You are encouraged to discuss homework problems with your fellow students.
  However, you have to write up your solutions by yourselves and show
  originality. Please write the names of any students you collaborated with on
  your assignment.

<h2>Grading Scale</h2>
<p>
  Letter grades will be assigned based on the cumulative score; the ranges
  corresponding to letter grades will be determined based on the difficulty of
  the exams and the following rubric:
</p>
<table>
  <th>Letter Grade</th>
  <th>Criteria</th>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>
      Able to perform basic computations in linear algebra and recite the
      definitions from the course. Demonstrates solid understanding of the
      theoretical aspects of the course.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>
      Able to perform basic computations in linear algebra and recite the
      definitions from the course. Demonstrates some understanding of the
      theoretical aspects of the course.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C</td>
    <td>
      Able to perform basic computations in linear algebra and recite the
      definitions from the course.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>D / F</td>
    <td>
      Fails to meet the expectations for a C.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Cumulative scores of 80/70/60 will receive at least an A-/B-/C-; however, the
  final breakpoints may be lowered. Grade ranges will be discussed in more
  detail after each exam.
