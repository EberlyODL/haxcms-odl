<p>
  Calculus is an important building block in the education of any professional
  who uses quantitative analysis. This course further introduces and develops
  the mathematical skills required for analyzing growth and change and creating
  mathematical models that replicate reallife phenomena. The goals of our
  calculus courses include to develop the students' knowledge of calculus
  techniques and to use the calculus environment to develop critical thinking
  and problem solving skills. This course covers the following topics:
  logarithms, exponentials, and inverse trigonometric functions; applications of
  the definite integral and techniques of integration; sequences and series;
  power series and Taylor polynomials; parametric equations and polar functions.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Calculators</h2>
<p>
  A graphics calculator is useful as a study and learning tool when used
  appropriately, but it is not essential. Calculus is a collection of ideas that
  is not mastered through calculator skills. Therefore, NO calculators are
  allowed on exams.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Exams</h2>
<p>
  Two 90-minute examinations will be given during the semester and a
  comprehensive final exam will be given at the end of the semester. All three
  of these exams are proctored exams.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Arranging a Proctor</h2>
<p>
  You will need to secure a proctor in order to take exams in this course. A
  proctor will not automatically be assigned to you; rather, you must make the
  necessary contacts to secure a professional who will serve in this capacity.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Contact a person who meets the qualifications and ask him or her to proctor
    your exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    Student Services must approve your proctor before any exams can be taken.
    Please see instructions for securing a
    <a
      style="text-decoration: none; color:#e2801e;"
      href="https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/courses/proctored-exams"
      target="_blank"
    >
      suitable proctor</a
    >
    . While many proctors will serve on a voluntary basis, you are responsible
    for paying any expenses incurred in retaining a proctor.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must complete a Proctor Information Form and submit the completed form
    with the proctor verification documentation. Note: If your proctor has been
    previously approved by the World Campus during a prior course within two
    years, you do not need to obtain verification. World Campus retains proctor
    information on file for two years.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your proctor does not meet the required specifications, Student Services
    will notify you within 5 to 7 business days.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will need to complete an Exam Request Form for each exam. Contact your
    proctor to confirm the date, time, and location of your exam(s). Complete
    the form 3 weeks prior to your scheduled exam to allow for processing the
    request and mailing exams to proctors. If you are located outside the United
    States, in order to allow adequate time for mailing, please plan to request
    your exam earlier than 3 weeks prior to the exam week.
  </li>
  <li>Contact Student Services if you cannot take a scheduled exam.</li>
</ul>
