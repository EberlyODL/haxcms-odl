<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  Calculus is an important building block in the education of any professional
  who uses quantitative analysis. This course further introduces and develops
  the mathematical skills required for analyzing growth and change and creating
  mathematical models that replicate real life phenomena. The goals of our
  calculus courses include to develop the students' knowledge of calculus
  techniques and to use the calculus environment to develop critical thinking
  and problem solving skills. This course covers the following topics:
  logarithms, exponentials, and inverse trigonometric functions; applications of
  the definite integral and techniques of integration; sequences and series;
  power series and Taylor polynomials; parametric equations and polar functions.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Calculators</h2>
<p>
  A graphics calculator is useful as a study and learning tool when used
  appropriately, but it is not essential. Calculus is a collection of ideas that
  is not mastered through calculator skills. Therefore, NO calculators are
  allowed on exams.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Exams</h2>
<p>
  Two 90-minute examinations will be given during the semester and a
  comprehensive final exam will be given at the end of the semester. All three
  of these exams are proctored exams.
