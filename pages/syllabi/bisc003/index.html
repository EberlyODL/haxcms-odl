<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The purpose of BI SC 003 is to help you prepare for living in the 21st century
  in a sustainable way. Through the course, you will come to realize that you
  are dependent upon and supported by natural systems, without which life on
  earth could not exist. By presenting ideas and concepts about living systems
  and their environment, it is hoped that an understanding of these biological
  and ecological principles and their application towards current environmental
  problems will give you the confidence to be a trustworthy instrument for
  healthy development, a conscientious steward of nature and an agent of change
  towards a sustainable society.
