<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Society and Disease Management is an investigation of how infectious diseases
  spread through populations and the economic and societal impacts of these
  diseases. An examination of the biological mechanisms of diseases and how
  disease burden is managed in communities will guide the rational for local and
  global health approaches to managing disease interventions. Class foundations
  include topics from biology, economics, systems theory, and health policy.
  Assessments will incorporate applications from all of these fields.

<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>
  This course is really one of those "you get out of it what you put into it"
  type of experiences. We do not aim to change your opinions but we do hope to
  help you consider national and international health issues at a deeper level
  than if you had not taken this course. Discussion boards will be a large part
  of this class. There will also be reflection/reaction essays to complete, as
  well as short videos and interactive activities from various websites for
  which you can earn points toward your final point total. We ask you to note
  topics or websites of interest as you research the various topics for this
  course. We strongly encourage suggestions for topics, assignments, and
  projects from you!
