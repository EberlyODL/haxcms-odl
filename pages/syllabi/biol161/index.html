<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  Thank you for coming along with us on this journey through the human body. We
  will be examining the structure and function of the human organ systems and
  more importantly, how they work together to ensure homeostasis in a healthy
  individual. As the first course of our anatomy and physiology series, we will
  focus on the integumentary, nervous, endocrine, skeletal and muscular systems.
  And when things go wrong, we will consider disease states. Welcome!
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Major Learning Objectives</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Recognize and explain the principle of homeostasis and the use of feedback
    loops to control physiological systems in the human body.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use anatomical knowledge to predict physiological consequences and use
    knowledge of function to explain the features of anatomical structures.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recognize and explain the interrelationships within and between the
    different body systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    Apply knowledge of anatomy and physiology to real-world situations,
    including clinical cases, health and lifestyle decisions, and homeostatic
    imbalances, by explaining and justifying your decision.
  </li>
  <li>
    Interpret and explain different types of anatomical images and graphs of
    physiological data.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">General Education Learning
  Objectives</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <i>Critical and Analytical Thinking</i> - The comprehensive exploration of
    issues,
    ideas, artifacts, and events before accepting or formulating a conclusion.
    It is the intellectually disciplined process of conceptualizing, applying,
    analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from,
    observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide
    to belief and action.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Integrative Thinking</i> – The ability to synthesize knowledge across
    multiple
    domains, as well as the ability to identify linkages between existing
    knowledge and new information. Individuals who engage in integrative
    thinking are able to transfer knowledge within and beyond current contexts.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Course Materials</h2>
<p>
  There are <i>no required texts</i> for this course. Readings and course
  materials
  will be posted directly to the PSU Canvas site.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to invest in a textbook, here are two suggested reference
  texts. However, we encourage you to peruse freely available e-Textbooks on the
  PSU Libraries website. Ask the instructor if you need help finding a quality
  textbook.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology 10th Ed. by Martini, Nath, and
    Bartholomew to be used as a reference
  </li>
  <li>
    Anatomy & Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function 7th Ed. by Ken Saladin
    to be used as a reference
  </li>
</ol>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Course Structure</h2>
<p>
  Each week you will work through one Canvas module (except for the first week
  of classes, which has two modules). All work is asynchronous. Each week/module
  will consist of the same four major components:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Engage</strong> - Each module will begin by presenting you with a
    clinical case study that highlights some of the topics we will be covering
    that week. You will also be given some guiding questions that we will
    answer that week (e.g. “how do bones grow?”, “how do neurons communicate
    with each other?”), and learning objectives.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Learn</strong> - Course content will be provided in each module in
    the form of text, images, and short videos. Each module will also contain a
    set of practice questions embedded within the content. Practice questions
    will not be graded, and are simply a chance for you to check your
    understanding of the concepts before completing any graded work. After
    reviewing the week’s content, you will submit a Foundation assignment (due
    Thursdays at midnight). Foundation assignments are graded open-book Canvas
    quizzes. The goal of this assignment is to ensure that you understand the
    fundamental ideas from that week’s material.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Apply</strong> - After reviewing the material and completing the
    Foundation assignment, you will then complete an Application assignment.
    Application assignments will have three major steps: 1) submission of a
    first draft (due Thursdays at midnight), 2) participation in a discussion
    forum (due Sundays at midnight), and 3) submission of a final draft (due
    Mondays at midnight). These assignments will require you to look at the
    material in greater depth, make connections to previous course material, and
    apply your knowledge to clinical correlations. Each Application assignment
    will tie in to the clinical case study from the beginning of the week. More
    information on these assignments is provided below.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reflect</strong> - The final section of every Application assignment
    will ask you to reflect on your learning that week and consider questions
    like: “what is a misconception you cleared up?”, “what was the most
    confusing topic this week and why?”, or “what is a question you still have
    on this week’s material?”. This type of reflection will help you evaluate
    your learning and progress throughout the course!
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The course also includes four short open-book exams, and one presentation
  project (see below for further details and due dates).

<p>
  Your grade will be calculated based on the following breakdown:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Foundation assignments: 18% of final grade (12 assignments, 1.5% each)</li>
  <li>Application assignments: 36% of final grade (12 assignments, 3% each)</li>
  <li>Exams: 36% of final grade (4 exams, 9% each)</li>
  <li>Presentation Project: 10% of final grade </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>There is no extra credit of any kind.</strong>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Grading Scale</h2>
<table>
  <th>Letter Grade</th>
  <th>% Score</th>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>93-100%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A-</td>
    <td>90-92%</td>

    <td>60-69%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F</td>
    <td>Less than 60%</td>

</table>
<p>
  There is no "rounding up" so if you earn 89.6% of the course points for
  instance, then your final course grade will be a B+ since you would still be
  below the 90% cut-off for the A-. If the average course grade for the entire
  class is below 70%, slightly lower cut-offs may be calculated based upon the
  average and standard deviation.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Assignment Descriptions</h2>
<p>
  <strong>Foundation Assignments</strong> - Due every Thursday at midnight.
  These assignments are open-book, non-timed, Canvas quizzes. Questions will
  be multiple choice, multiple select, true/false, and matching. These
  assignments will assess your knowledge of basic facts and concepts presented
  in that week’s module. Practice questions will also be provided within each
  module. You are encouraged to complete each module’s practice questions
  before submitting any assignments, but it is not required. The “Syllabus
  Quiz” in the first module will be counted as a Foundation assignment and one
  lowest Foundation assignment grade will be dropped when calculating your
  final course grade. Each Foundation assignment is worth 10 points.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Application Assignments and Discussion</strong> - These assignments
  will consist of a series of short-answer questions. They will tie in with
  that week’s clinical case, and will ask you to apply your knowledge of
  anatomy and physiology to real-world scenarios. These assignments are
  designed to be more challenging than the Foundation assignments, so you will
  have the chance to get feedback on them from peers and your instructor. Each
  Application assignment is worth 15 points (5 points for the discussion, 10
  points for the final submission). There will be three stages to the
  submission of each application assignment:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Submit an initial draft of the assignment to that week’s discussion
    board (Due Thursdays at midnight). This draft does NOT have to be perfect,
    and will not be graded for accuracy, but you are expected to try to answer
    all of the questions. In your initial comment on the discussion board, you
    should include your draft of the assignment (worth 2 points), and pose at
    least one question (worth 1 point). Your question(s) can be about the
    application assignment, or about any other topic from that week’s module,
    but should be something that you would like feedback/clarification/input
    on from other students and your instructor. Although the Foundation
    assignment and the first draft of the Application assignment have the same
    due date (both are due at midnight on Thursdays for simplicity), you are
    strongly encouraged to first complete your Foundation assignment before
    beginning the Application assignment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Submit comments on at least two other students’ drafts/questions in the
    discussion board. In your comment, you should try to answer their question
    and give feedback on their draft (what you agree on, what you disagree on,
    and why). Your comments are worth 2 points, and are due Sundays at
    midnight. Your instructor will also submit comments to the discussion
    during this time-period to help address any questions or misconceptions.
  </li>
  <li>
    After reviewing the feedback on your draft from your classmates and the
    instructor, you will submit a final draft of your assignment for a grade
    (Due Mondays at midnight, worth 10 points).
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The “Introduce Yourself” discussion in the first module will be counted as
  an Application assignment and one lowest Application assignment grade will
  be dropped when calculating your final grade in the course.
</p>
<p>
  In the discussion boards, you will be interacting with your peers and we
  expect you to do so in a respectful and thoughtful manner. By participating
  in this course, you agree to take on the mutual responsibility to maintain a
  safe, inclusive, and welcoming learning environment for all. You agree to:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Approach each interaction with empathy.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Every member of this course has a different background, set of life
      experiences, and story. We agree to listen, let people speak for
      themselves, and focus on inquiring instead of interrogating.
    </li>
    <li>
      Every member of this course does not have equal access to the course.
      We are all currently in different working environments – trying to come
      together in this learning environment. We will be patient and considerate.
    </li>
    <li>
      We are a diverse group of learners. We will be cognizant of social
      disparities and do our best to create an equitable experience for all.
    </li>
    <li>
      Constructive criticism and feedback generally includes (1) a positive
      comment or something the post made you consider differently as well as (2)
      an opportunity for improvement.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Be an active bystander.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>We will recognize disrespectful language.</li>
    <li>We will intervene, or step in to say we do not allow that language in
      our community.</li>
    <li>We will respectfully tell people, including the instructors, how they
      can be better. Everyone is always improving and learning. We can help each
      other in the process. </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<p>
  <strong>Exams</strong> - Four exams will be given throughout the course (see
  schedule above). Each exam will cover the previous three modules (exams are
  not cumulative, including the final exam). Each exam is only worth 9% of your
  final grade in the course, so do not think of these as being too intimidating!
  Exams will be open-book, but are timed. Exam questions will be mostly short
  answer, but may also include some multiple choice, multiple select, true/false
  and/or matching questions. Although the exams are open-book, it is very
  important that work on them entirely by yourself. Collaborating or sharing
  exam questions or answers with any other person (inside or outside the course)
  will be treated as a serious violation of academic integrity (see below).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Presentation Project</strong> - You will complete one Presentation
  Project during the course, which will be worth 10% of your final grade. For
  this project, you will create a short video presentation on one of the
  course’s topics. Presentations will be spread out throughout the course.
  During the first week of the course, you will be asked to sign up for a
  specific presentation due date. You are welcome to choose any presentation
  topic and due date that you like, but once you make your choice you will not
  be permitted to change it unless you have major extenuating circumstances
  (such as a major illness). General topics and due dates are as follows:
</p>
<table>
  <th>Presentation Group</th>
  <th>Potenial Topics (Modules)</th>
  <th>Due Date</th>
  <tr>
    <td>Group 1</td>
    <td>Chemistry & Cell Stucture, Tissues, Skin</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Group 2</td>
    <td>Intro to Nervous System, Electrophysiology 1, Electrophysiology 2</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Group 3</td>
    <td>Secretion & Nervious Divisions, Brain & Special Senses, Skeletal Muscle
      Histology</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Group 4</td>
    <td>Muscle Contraction, Skeleton & Joints, Hormones & Skeleton</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to create a short video presentation that will be
  a useful study aid for your fellow students (note that due dates for each of
  the above groups are shortly before the corresponding exams). A complete
  project description and grading rubric are posted on Canvas in the
  Introduction module- please read through these carefully! Your video will
  ultimately be uploaded to YouTube (unlisted), where other students will be
  able to view it. If, after reading through the assignment description, you
  have any concerns about the technology/software needed to complete this
  project, please speak to your instructor.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have signed up for one of the Presentation dates listed above, you
  will be given a more specific list of presentation topics that you may choose
  from (but your topic will be from within one of the modules listed above).
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Late Assignment Policy</h2>
<p>
  All Foundation assignments and final Application submissions will be accepted
  <strong>up to one week late for half credit</strong> (i.e., a maximum score of
  5 points each).
  If you have a situation that is causing you to miss assignments or fall
  behind, please speak to your instructor! Your instructor may grant you an
  extension if your circumstances warrant it (situations such as major illness,
  death in the family, etc.). You cannot earn any points for late submission of
  your Application draft or discussion comments (worth 5 points), since the goal
  of these is to get timely feedback and participate in a discussion with your
  peers before the final draft of the assignment is due.
</p>
<p>
  Exams will be open for 24 hours on the day that they are assigned, meaning
  that you can take them anytime during that 24-hour window. In general, exam
  makeups will only be given in specific circumstances (including major illness,
  death in the family, a PSU recognized religious holiday, or PSU sponsored
  event such as an athletic competition). If you need an exam makeup, you must
  request your makeup before the exam begins in order for your request to be
  considered. If you forget to take an exam, for example, you will receive a 0
  on that exam. If you have a technical problem occur while you are taking an
  exam, please email your instructor right away so that they can address the
  issue and ensure that you can complete the exam. If you do not notify your
  instructor right away of any technical problem, you may not be permitted to
  re-take the exam or make up any questions that you missed.
</p>
<p>
  You will be given a specific due date for your Presentation Project, depending
  on what topic you choose to present on. Your Presentation Project will be
  accepted up to one week late, however you will <strong>lose 10% of your grade for each
    day that it is late</strong>. It is especially important to submit these projects on
  time, because they will be a useful resource for other students while they are
  preparing for the corresponding exam.
</p>
