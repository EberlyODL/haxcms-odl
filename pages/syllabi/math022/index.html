<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  College Algebra II represents a significant opportunity for students to
  discover the beauty and practical power of mathematics. Concepts and skills
  are taught while at the same time a sense of algebra's utility in the real
  world is imparted. This course provides indepth coverage of college algebra
  topics that students continuing in mathematics will require. This is the kind
  of mathematics that students will use the rest of their lives in many fields.
  MATH 022 is a preparatory course intended to provide mathematical background
  in algebra with a function/graph emphasis required in calculus courses.
  Linear, polynomial, rational, exponential and logarithmic functions and their
  graphs provide necessary models for mathematical applications.

        Extensive review of intermediate algebra topics. The review will
        include: solving linear equations and inequalities, fundamental concepts
        associated with quadratic equations, solving equations and inequalities
        with absolute values and other miscellaneous equations involving
        rational expressions and radical expressions. An introduction to complex
        number arithmetic is also included.

        General concepts associated with relations and functions. Topics such as
        the algebra of functions, function composition and range and domain are
        studied. The graphical representation of linear and quadratic functions
        are also presented. The algebraic and graphical representation of
        circles will also be studied as it pertains to terminology associated
        with relations in general. Basic graphical transformations are
        introduced.

        Polynomial and rational functions are studied in detail. In particular,
        ideas associated with zeros of polynomials, end-behavior, and graph
        sketching are discussed. The unit includes synthetic division, the
        remainder theorem, the conjugate root theorem, horizontal and slant
        (oblique) asymptotes, and vertical asymptotes.

        Exponential and logarithmic functions are studied in detail. Specific
        skills entail working with the rules of exponents and logarithms and
        solving exponential and logarithmic equations. Concepts associated with
        one-to-one functions and the existence of inverses are also studied.
        Sketching and recognizing the graphical representation of exponential
        and log functions is included.

<h2>Algebraic Skills</h2>
<p>
  Algebraic skills will be primarily developed through work on ALEKS. ALEKS is a
  web-based tutorial system which provides students with ongoing skills based
  assessments and tracks progress. The midterm and final exams will also entail
  skills based problems.
</p>
<p>
  As necessary, lectures will be done via BlackBoard Collaborate. The midterm
  and final exams will administered via Canvas.
</p>
<h2>Conceptual Skills</h2>
<p>
  Conceptual Skills will be incorporated in lectures, reading, and activities.
  Lectures and activities will be conducted approximately every other week. A
  typical lecture and/or activity will tie skill based ideas together to provide
  a larger overview of the topics. Lectures will be done via Elluminate and
  activities will be based upon discussion board prompts and/or assigned tasks
  from the text. The final exam will also incorporate questions which relate to
  the conceptual tasks.
</p>
<h2>ALEKS</h2>
<p>
  Essentially all of the skills based work will be conducted through ALEKS. The
  ALEKS system will do ongoing assessments of skills based problems and track
  student progress. ALEKS is a major component of the course and a typical
  college algebra student will need to plan on 4-6 hours of online work each
  week (50-60 hours for the course). Skills based points will be earned by
  measuring mastered objective milestones and skills based ALEKS quizzes.
</p>
<h2>Readings / Problems</h2>
<p>
  he text will be primarily used to tie ideas to concepts and skills together.
  This will be done through assigned readings and suggested problems.
  Occasionally, a problem may be selected to emphasize a specific skill that
  ALEKS did not adequately incorporate. Some of the activities will stem from
  the text. Finally, the text will support the ALEKS work in that explanations
  within ALEKS will reference specific areas from the text for further reading.
</p>
<h2>Lecture Attendance</h2>
<p>
  Elluminate is the web-conference utility where the virtual classroom resides.
  This may also be used for more "face-to-face" group correspondence with
  students.
</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  The total number of points for the course will be 1000 points. Students will
  have an opportunity to earn 200 points in each of the following three areas:
  1) Basic Skills (ALEKS work), 2) Conceptual Understanding (Activities and
  quizzes), and 3) the Final Exam (incorporates both basic skills and conceptual
  understanding). The final grade will be determined by the sum of these three
  areas. The minimum of the three area scores and the maximum of the three area
  scores will be incorporated twice and thus each of these two areas will will
  contribute to 40% of your overall grade as each will be worth 400 points. This
  rubric emphasizes that all three areas are of utmost importance.

<h2>Arranging a Proctor</h2>
<p>
  You will need to secure a proctor in order to take exams in this course. A
  proctor will not automatically be assigned to you; rather, you must make the
  necessary contacts to secure a professional who will serve in this capacity.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Contact a person who meets the qualifications and ask him or her to proctor
    your exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    Student Services must approve your proctor before any exams can be taken.
    Please see instructions for securing a
    <a
      href="https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/courses/proctored-exams"
      target="_blank"
      >suitable proctor</a
    >
    . While many proctors will serve on a voluntary basis, you are responsible
    for paying any expenses incurred in retaining a proctor.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must complete a Proctor Information Form and submit the completed form
    with the proctor verification documentation. Note: If your proctor has been
    previously approved by the World Campus during a prior course within two
    years, you do not need to obtain verification. World Campus retains proctor
    information on file for two years.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your proctor does not meet the required specifications, Student Services
    will notify you within 5 to 7 business days.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will need to complete an Exam Request Form for each exam. Contact your
    proctor to confirm the date, time, and location of your exam(s). Complete
    the form 3 weeks prior to your scheduled exam to allow for processing the
    request and mailing exams to proctors. If you are located outside the United
    States, in order to allow adequate time for mailing, please plan to request
    your exam earlier than 3 weeks prior to the exam week.
  </li>
  <li>Contact Student Services if you cannot take a scheduled exam.</li>
</ul>
