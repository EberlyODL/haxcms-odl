<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  MATH 110 is an entry-level course in mathematics that introduces the skills
  associated with the application of calculus techniques to business and social
  science applications. We will review and deepen our understanding of
  polynomial and exponential functions as well as introduce the concepts of
  derivatives and integration. Most topics will be explored analytically and
  graphically as they are applied to real life examples and problems. Students
  are expected to study the concepts and examples and be able to extend the
  skills and techniques to the solution of similar problems.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Prerequisite</h2>
<p>
  MATH 022 or satisfactory performance on the mathematics proficiency
  examination.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>
  Math 110, Techniques of Calculus I focuses on learning and practicing the
  fundamental rules of calculus and their applications to business and the
  social sciences. You will get some exposure to mathematical proofs in the
  readings and lectures. I will take many opportunities to remind you of the
  underlying concepts during lecture, and you should attain a broad conceptual
  understanding of the theory by semester's end. You will be pushed to consider
  concepts more deeply during activities and group discussion. However, the
  assessments and exams are problem centered.

<ul>
  <li>
    Identify polynomial, rational, power, exponential, and logarithmic
    functions.

<p>
  Applied Calculus for the Managerial, Life, and Social Sciences A Brief
  Approach, 8th Edition by S. T. Tan (Brooks/Cole, 2009)
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Lessons</h2>
<p>
  Each lesson will include a set of prerecorded lectures covering topics for the
  week. These lectures are typically 10-15 minutes in length (60-90 mins total).
  Each lecture covers one or two particular topics or concepts, along with
  examples. This allows you to focus on one topic at a time, at your own pace,
  though the pace must be fast enough to keep up with the overall course.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Activity</h2>
<p>
  Each week there will be an activity containing additional suggested problems
  and conceptual questions with solutions. This activity is not graded, but
  working through the problems and questions should be helpful in preparing you
  for quizzes and exams.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Office Hours / Recitation</h2>
<p>
  Each week (time to be determined and announced) there will be a live
  recitation. This will be an opportunity for you to get more in depth feedback
  about particular problems, review more involved examples, and be reminded of
  important concepts in the week's lesson. These sessions will be recorded for
  those who are not able to attend the live lecture. However, the content of the
  recitation will depend on your questions and/or the points of difficulty in
  the lesson. If you are not able to attend the live lecture, you may still
  submit questions via email or the discussion forum on Piazza.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Problem Quiz (30 pts)</h2>
<p>
  Each lesson will have a problem quiz worth 30 points. You can take each
  problem quiz up to 3 times; you will have immediate feedback on the solutions
  after taking each quiz. Your quiz grade will be based on the highest score of
  the 3 attempts. Your overall quiz score for the course will be based on the
  ten best lessons.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Concept Quiz (10 pts)</h2>
<p>
  Each lesson will have a concept quiz worth 10 points. You are only allowed one
  attempt on the concept quiz. Make sure you read through the lesson activity
  and try the practice questions there before taking the concept quiz.
