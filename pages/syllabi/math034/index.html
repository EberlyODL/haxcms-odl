<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  The mathematics of money course allows students to learn mathematical
  techniques that aid in the understanding of life's financial decisions, such
  as those involving interest, annuities, investments, retirement plans, taxes,
  credit cards, and mortgages. The goal of this course is to help students
  develop the knowledge and skills needed to make sound financial decisions. The
  U.S. Department of Treasury has stated that "Today's complex
  financial-services market offers consumers a vast array of products and
  providers to meet their financial needs. This degree of choice requires that
  consumers be equipped with the knowledge and skills to evaluate the options
  and identify those that best suit their needs and circumstances." This course
  will help students obtain this knowledge and skills.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Objectives</h2>
<p>Upon successful completion of Math 034, the student should be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Understand the concept of the time value of money, recognize the reasoning
    behind the payment of interest and use the simple interest formula to find
    the principal, interest, simple interest rate, or term of a loan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use linear equations, arithmetic sequences and linear functions to analyze
    interest problems.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the simple discount formula to find the maturity value, proceeds, simple
    discount, simple discount rate, or term of a discount note.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use geometric sequences and partial geometric sums to understand the concept
    of compound interest.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the basic compound interest formula, exponential functions and
    logarithms to solve problems of compound interest which entail different
    compounding frequencies, future values and present values.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use infinite geometric sums to approximate economic stimulation/impact.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use mathematical expectation to set interest associated with loan risk.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use geometric sequences and partial geometric sums to understand the concept
    of an annuity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculate the future and/or present value of an annuity and an annuity
    payment using annuity formulas and logarithms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use graphical representations and interpretation to understand the concept
    of amortization.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the structure of state sales tax and federal income taxes,
    calculate the total taxes owed, and calculate the federal income tax
    withholding and FICA for payroll deductions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use financial formulas and linear equations to calculate dividend rates,
    dividend yields, compound annual growth rates, and total rates of return for
    investments in stocks, bonds and mutual funds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculate the employee contribution and employer matching for different
    retirement plans and calculate the impact of contributions made to
    traditional and Roth IRAs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use geometric sequences, partial geometric sums and linear systems of
    equations to solve problems which incorporate inflation and make projections
    for investments that take into account the impact of inflation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use geometric sequences, partial geometric sums, linear equations, and
    exponential decay models to solve problems associated with depreciation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculate credit card interest and compare credit card offers for their
    annual fees and interest rates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculate the equity, maximum loan amount, and closing costs for a mortgage
    loan.
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculate the monthly payment on a lease, given the residual value and
    interest rate and understand the financial difference between leasing and
    buying.
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculate price, cost, percent markup or markdown, gross profit margin and
    net profit margin.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the concept of cost-revenue analysis and break-even points as it
    applies to financial problems.
  </li>
</ul>
