<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Biology 155 is a 3-credit lecture course designed to give both science and
  non-science majors a basic understanding of the aging process, with special
  emphasis on aging as it relates to the human body and health. The first third
  of the course will discuss important aging terminology, methods of measuring
  aging, current theories of the aging process, and research models used to
  study aging. The later two thirds of the course will review aging as related
  to specific body systems. As such, portions of lessons will review normal
  anatomy (structure naming) and physiology (body function) of these body
  systems. In this later section, details of both senescence and age-related
  disease processes will be discussed.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Upon completion of this course, you will have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed a functional understanding of how our bodies change over time
  </li>
  <li>
    Gained a perspective on major diseases that affect our aging bodies
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand how long-term, healthy living strategies and interventions,
    started during young life, can potentially prolong life and add additional
    healthy years to our lifespan
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  Your course grade will be based upon your performance on the lesson
  assignments and two examinations. The lesson assignments will be 1/3 of the
  final course grade, with the mid-course counting as 1/3 and the final counting
  as the last 1/3. Examinations will have 30 multiple choice, matching and
  true/false questions, worth 80% of the exam points, and the remaining 20% of
  the exam points will be performance on a short essay and term definitions. The
  mid-course exam will stress material developed in lesson assignments 2-7. The
  final exam will stress material developed in lesson assignments 9-14, and will
  not be comprehensive. That said, some broad concepts developed throughout the
  course, could be found in some questions.
