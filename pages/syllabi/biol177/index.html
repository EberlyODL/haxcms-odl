<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Description</h2>
<p>
  This course presents a thorough background on the basic structure and function
  of the human reproductive system. Goals are to provide the student with
  sufficient knowledge to understand and discuss sex-related topics and make
  informed personal decisions. Through online presentations and class discussion
  students will be exposed to information that will clarify their understanding
  of the ways that their own body functions in sexual behavior and reproduction.
  Importantly, students will examine the roles of reproductive physiology and
  sexuality in a historical, cultural and social context, with particular
  emphasis on cultural and gender differences in anatomical forms, sexual
  expression, and disease. The course will present current research on human sex
  and reproduction, and explore the biology behind human sexuality and medicine.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Quizzes consist of 5-10 multiple choice, ordering, multiple select and
  true/false questions based on the weekly lectures and web assignments. These
  will be available in Canvas in the weekly modules folders. You can submit the
  quiz anytime during the week, but you will be given 15-20 minutes to complete
  the quiz and only one attempt. Do not open the quiz until you have viewed all
  the course material for that week. You will be presented with 14 quizzes, but
  only your top 12 quiz scores will be considered in the final grade
  calculation. If you fail to take a quiz in the allotted time for any reason it
  will be counted as one of your dropped scores.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Discussion Boards</h2>
<p>
  Discussion boards require full class participation. Each discussion board is a
  maximum of 5 points total. Discussion topics are testable on exams and you may
  see exam questions on that material. It is in your best interest to check back
  and read comments throughout the week. Posting to the discussion board after
  the due date when classmates are no longer engaging is pointless (there is no
  one else logging on to discuss) and therefore worth 0 points. I do not accept
  late discussion posts under any circumstances. Discussions cannot be reopened
  after they close for any reason including hospitalization, deaths, or other
  emergencies. Be sure to log on and comment at least once.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Exam / Quiz Policy</h2>
<p>
  All quizzes and Exams are to be taken closed book. All exams and assignments
  are worth approximately ~400 total points. Weekly assignments and/or quizzes
  are due on Sunday at 11:59PM Eastern Standard Time. Something is due every
  week so make sure you are keeping up and doing the assignments for each week.
  Quizzes cannot be accessed after 11:59pm Eastern Standard Time (NO
  EXCEPTIONS). Failing to allow enough time to complete and submit the
  assignment is not a valid excuse and does not qualify as an emergency. Missed
  quizzes will count as a dropped grade. Quizzes cannot be reopened after they
  close for any reason including hospitalization, deaths, or other emergencies.
</p>
<p>
  Exams consist of ~25 multiple choice/ short answer questions and are weighted
  to be worth 50 points each. You are responsible for all material presented
  online and assigned articles and readings. You many not use your notes when
  taking exams or quizzes. You may not perform internet searches when taking
  exams or quizzes. The final is not cumulative; it is simply a fourth test.
  Exams will be taken using Canvas. You may open an exam only one time and must
  submit your answers within a 60 minute period. You will need to schedule an
  appointment with Examity to access the proctored Exams. Exams can be canceled
  and rescheduled however 24 hoursâ€™ notice is required. In rare instances I can
  grant extensions for exams given an extreme illness or emergency. Exam
  Extension requests must be made within 7 days of the exam.
