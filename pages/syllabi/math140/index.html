<p>
  Calculus is an important building block in the education of any professional
  who uses quantitative analysis. This course introduces and develops the
  mathematical skills required for analyzing change and creating mathematical
  models that replicate real-life phenomena. The goals of our calculus courses
  include to develop the students' knowledge of calculus techniques and to use
  the calculus environment to develop critical thinking and problem solving
  skills. The concept of limit is central to calculus; MATH 140 begins with a
  study of this concept. Differential calculus topics include derivatives and
  their applications to rates of change, related rates, linearization,
  optimization, and graphing techniques. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
  relating differential and integral calculus begins the study of Integral
  Calculus. Antidifferentiation and the technique of substitution is used in
  integration applications of finding areas of plane figures and volumes of
  solids of revolution. Trigonometric functions are included in every topic.

  Calculus, Seventh Edition, (OR) Calculus(Single Variable), Seventh Edition, by
  James Stewart, published by Thomson (Brooks/Cole). ISBN13: 978-0-538-49781-7

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Calculators</h2>
<p>
  A graphics calculator is useful as a study and learning tool when used
  appropriately, but it is not essential. Calculus is a collection of ideas that
  is not mastered through calculator skills. Therefore, NO calculators are
  allowed on exams.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Exams</h2>
<p>
  Two 90-minute examinations will be given during the semester and a
  comprehensive final exam will be given at the end of the semester. All three
  of these exams are proctored exams.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Arranging a Proctor</h2>
<p>
  You will need to secure a proctor in order to take exams in this course. A
  proctor will not automatically be assigned to you; rather, you must make the
  necessary contacts to secure a professional who will serve in this capacity.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Contact a person who meets the qualifications and ask him or her to proctor
    your exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    Student Services must approve your proctor before any exams can be taken.
    Please see instructions for securing a
    <a
      style="text-decoration: none; color:#e2801e;"
      href="https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/courses/proctored-exams"
      target="_blank"
    >
      suitable proctor</a
    >
    . While many proctors will serve on a voluntary basis, you are responsible
    for paying any expenses incurred in retaining a proctor.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must complete a Proctor Information Form and submit the completed form
    with the proctor verification documentation. Note: If your proctor has been
    previously approved by the World Campus during a prior course within two
    years, you do not need to obtain verification. World Campus retains proctor
    information on file for two years.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your proctor does not meet the required specifications, Student Services
    will notify you within 5 to 7 business days.
  </li>
  <li>
    You will need to complete an Exam Request Form for each exam. Contact your
    proctor to confirm the date, time, and location of your exam(s). Complete
    the form 3 weeks prior to your scheduled exam to allow for processing the
    request and mailing exams to proctors. If you are located outside the United
    States, in order to allow adequate time for mailing, please plan to request
    your exam earlier than 3 weeks prior to the exam week.
  </li>
  <li>Contact Student Services if you cannot take a scheduled exam.</li>
</ul>
