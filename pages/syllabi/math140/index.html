<p>
  Calculus is an important building block in the education of any professional
  who uses quantitative analysis. This course introduces and develops the
  mathematical skills required for analyzing change and creating mathematical
  models that replicate real-life phenomena. The goals of our calculus courses
  include to develop the students' knowledge of calculus techniques and to use
  the calculus environment to develop critical thinking and problem solving
  skills. The concept of limit is central to calculus; MATH 140 begins with a
  study of this concept. Differential calculus topics include derivatives and
  their applications to rates of change, related rates, linearization,
  optimization, and graphing techniques. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
  relating differential and integral calculus begins the study of Integral
  Calculus. Antidifferentiation and the technique of substitution is used in
  integration applications of finding areas of plane figures and volumes of
  solids of revolution. Trigonometric functions are included in every topic.

<p>
  Calculus, Seventh Edition, (OR) Calculus(Single Variable), Seventh Edition, by
  James Stewart, published by Thomson (Brooks/Cole). ISBN13: 978-0-538-49781-7
  (OR) ISBN13: 978-0-538-49783-1 ebook options available from Cengage Learning.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Calculators</h2>
<p>
  A graphics calculator is useful as a study and learning tool when used
  appropriately, but it is not essential. Calculus is a collection of ideas that
  is not mastered through calculator skills. Therefore, NO calculators are
  allowed on exams.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Exams</h2>
<p>
  Two 90-minute examinations will be given during the semester and a
  comprehensive final exam will be given at the end of the semester. All three
  of these exams are proctored exams.
