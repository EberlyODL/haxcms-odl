<p><span>There are two ways to record your sessions, recording "locally" or recording in the "cloud". </span>We recommend using the "cloud" option.  This saves you the steps of uploading the file to Kaltura after you session has completed.  The "cloud" option handles saving the file and uploading it to the Kaltura service. To enable the "cloud" option in zoom.<br/></p>
