   has developed a guide called the,
  <i>Science of Learning Guide to Education Technology</i>. It was created by
  everyday classroom teachers in an everyday school, and designed to help
  teachers use education technology in the most effective way possible. It
  starts with the science of how students learn, lays out a simple path to get
  learning to happen, then maps real-world tested EdTech tools that support
  learning.
