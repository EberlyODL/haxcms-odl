  Videos require accurate captions that are used by students with disabilities
  as well as many students looking to increase comprehension. Visual content

    >write meaningful alternative text and/or long descriptions</a
  >. If you were to give a description of your visual content over the phone,

  NOTE: machine captions are only 70-80% accurate and not 100% accessible within
  the Kaltura Caption Editor. If you choose to use a YouTube video that contains
  machine captions that you don’t have access to edit, you can link the Youtube
  video into a Kaltura instance, generate machine captions and then edit them
  for accuracy/upload them using the same caption editing method listed above.
