  When publishing content online, it is important to ensure all accessibility
  standards are met. Videos require accurate captions that are used by
  students with disabilities as well as many students looking to increase
  comprehension.&nbsp;Visual content such as graphics and photographs
  require&nbsp;you to&nbsp;<a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/"
    >write meaningful alternative text and/or long descriptions</a
  >. If you were to give a description of your visual content over the phone,
  the person on the other end should be able to visualize your content by only
  hearing your text description.&nbsp;

  When using Kaltura to upload or record Kaltura Capture videos, you have the
  option to create or order captions to&nbsp;<a

    >upload your own caption file</a
  >, or&nbsp;<a

    >order free machine-generated captions and edit the captions for
    accuracy&nbsp;</a
  >(machine captions are only 70-80% accurate and not 100% accessible) within
  the Kaltura Caption Editor. If you choose to use a YouTube video that
  contains machine captions that you don’t have access to edit, you
  can&nbsp;<a
    href="http://you can link the Youtube video into a Kaltura instance"
    >link the Youtube video into a Kaltura instance</a
  >, generate machine captions and then edit them for accuracy/upload them
  using the same caption editing method listed above.
