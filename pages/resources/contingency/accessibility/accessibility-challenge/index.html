<p>
  In honor of August and these final dog days of summer, the Office of Digital
  Learning would like to invite you to participate in our <strong>August
    Accessibility
    Challenge</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  In 1990, Congress passed a series of <a href="https://www.nad.org/resources/technology/captioning-for-access/when-is-captioning-required/" target="_blank">landmark anti-discrimination laws</a> that
  require public and private organizations to take strides to accommodate those
  with recognized disabilities trying to use their services or goods. The ADA is
  most notorious for its rules about accessibility, but it also governs closed
  captioning. If a video, PowerPoint presentation, or commercial is available
  publicly, it is legally required to be captioned. Penn State was once sued for
  inaccessible content: <a href="https://accessibility.psu.edu/nfbpsusettlement/" target="_blank">Settlement Between Penn State University and National
    Federation of the Blind (psu.edu)</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, our goal is to help familiarize you with some of the processes
  where you can make your materials more accessible to all students in
  accordance with Federal law. Each week, we will provide you with the challenge
  and instructions on how to complete the challenge. You--if you choose to
  accept the mission--will work through the steps to make your content more
  accessible and submit it to our Submission folder. Those participants who
  complete all 4 challenges will be entered into a drawing for some fun College
  of Science/ODL swag. Ultimately, the biggest prize will be your expanded
  ability to help make content accessible for our students. We wish you the best
  of luck. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.
