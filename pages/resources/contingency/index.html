  can take that make it a little more manageable.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Put your syllabus online. You can upload your syllabus as a Word Document or a PDF to Canvas so that students
    have access to all the important and relevant information about the course.<ul>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make a statement in your syllabus about what would happen if classes were cancelled, including how the class may
    change and how you will stay in contact with them.<ul>
      <li><a href="https://sites.psu.edu/virusinfo/">Penn State Virus Info</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If something does happen, get details about the event. Find out what Penn State is saying and the policies
    around the event.</li>
  <li>Talk with your department. Departments may have unique strategies and plans for their own particular courses.

      Inbox</a> to mail students about changes that are coming and any details they need to know.</li>
  <li>Make sure you set realistic goals for instruction. What can you move online and how do you ensure students will
    have structure and be accountable for their learning.</li>
  <li>Determine course priorities. What do students really need to know?</li>
  <li>Review your syllabus for places where instruction may change. How will you modify due dates and assignments? You
    will need to update your syllabus accordingly.</li>
  <li>Realize that this is as tough on your students as it is for you. What will participation look like now and how
    you can be equitable and accommodating to all?</li>

    know.</li>
