  When you require synchronous learning, you are putting a burden on the student
  to structure their life around a time-based commitment. At the same time,
  however, you are also helping students who are not used to distance education
  to find structure and space to focus on what they need to learn.

  Some faculty employ a mix of both. They record a lecture in advance
  (asynchronous) and ask students to come to class (synchronous) to perform some
  sort of active learning. Or they may ask student to attend a live lecture
  (synchronous) and post a recording of the event so students can access it
  later (asynchronous.)

<p>
  Synchronous learning is learning that occurs at a specific time via a specific
  medium. It can happen via video- or tele-conferencing, live chatting, or
  live-streaming lectures.
