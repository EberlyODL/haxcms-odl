<p>
  When you require synchronous learning, you are putting a burden on the student
  to structure their life around a time-based commitment. At the same time,
  however, you are also helping students who are not used to distance education
  to find structure and space to focus on what they need to learn.
</p>
<p>
  Some faculty employ a mix of both. They record a lecture in advance
  (asynchronous) and ask students to come to class (synchronous) to perform some
  sort of active learning. Or they may ask student to attend a live lecture
  (synchronous) and post a recording of the event so students can access it
  later (asynchronous.)

  Strategies for Creating Engaging Synchronous and Asynchronous Learning
  Environments
</h2>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Introduction</h3>
<p>
  This page demonstrates how faculty can consider the impact of interaction in
  their teaching. The following definitions will help to clarify the methods
  that we can use to engage the students in interaction in face-to-face, hybrid,
  and online instruction, whether in the traditional formats or in a Remote
  Instruction context.
</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Synchronous & Asynchronous Instruction</h3>
<p>
  A key component of instruction in online education is the difference between
  synchronous and asynchronous instruction. While this is an assumed component
  of residential face-to-face instruction, it is helpful to intentionally
  consider it for your hybrid or online instruction.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>In synchronous instruction</strong> or activities, the faculty
    member and the students interact with one another at the same time, often
    through audio or video communication tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Asynchronous instruction</strong> and activities, then, is the
    opposite where there is no requirement for faculty and students to connect
    with one another at the same time.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Methods of Interaction</h3>
<p>
  Whether faculty engage with students synchronously or asynchronously, there
  are three primary interaction types that research shows take place within the
  online classroom (Friesen & Kuskis, 2013). The interactions show a teaching
  and learning relationship between students and their peers, instructors and
  their students, and students and the learning content. These interactions can
  take place through text, audio, video, or images so long as the two parties
  involved actively engage with each person or media for the cultivation of
  discourse (Friesen & Kuskis, 2013). It’s helpful to note that the titles
  themselves (e.g. Student-Student) do not presume a transactional method but a
  dynamic exchange between both parties. The Teacher-Student interaction type
  infers that the instructor will impact the student and the student will impact
  the instructor, not just that the instructor will direct the student.
</p>
<h4 style="font-weight: 400;">Student-Student Interaction</h4>
<p>
  In this interaction method, students communicate with one another, analyze
  each other’s work, encourage one another’s thoughts, and actively engage one
  another. This relationship does not presume one student having authority over
  another but an equitable platform for all students to share their learning.
</p>
<h4 style="font-weight: 400;">Teacher-Student Interaction</h4>
<p>In this interaction method, instructors and students exchange expectations, provide feedback, and respectfully challenge one another. In this way, the instructor does instruct the students through their interactions but the student can also provide insights or changes to the instructor that can improve the learning experience for all participants.</p>
<h4 style="font-weight: 400;">Student-Content Interaction</h4>
<p>In this interaction method, it is expected that the students will actively engage the learning content in all of its media types. However, it also presumes that the content is well prepared and organized for access. This interaction type assumes that students will critically engage the content for both its literal and potentially metaphorical values.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Synchronous Learning</h2>
<p>
  Synchronous learning is learning that occurs at a specific time via a specific
  medium. It can happen via video- or tele-conferencing, live chatting, or
  live-streaming lectures.
</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Provides students and faculty a familiar context that maintains the pace of
    the course and the invaluable opportunity for faculty-student interaction.
  </li>
  <li>Gives students much needed structure.</li>
  <li>Preserves the sense of community and classroom culture.</li>
  <li>
    Allows students to ask the instructor questions and receive live feedback.
  </li>
  <li>Useful for imparting key ideas or providing a forum to many.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Students may be in different time zone.</li>
  <li>
    Students may have to work around family schedules or computer use to be in
    class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students may have other obligations to attend to when they are situated at
    home or outside of class, such as a job or a child.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Asynchronous Learning</h2>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Allows for students who are shy or introverts to have the ability to think
    in detail and respond how they want.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allows for instructors to build more flexible and personalized interactions
    by utilizing ed tech tools.
  </li>
  <li>May provide several different ways/modes for students to learn.</li>
  <li>
    Could potentially be very simple, requiring low bandwidth and simple tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    Struggling with questions or answers may provide deeper learning
    opportunities for students.
  </li>
  <li>
    If students are working in groups, they can have some control over their own
    learning experience and time schedule.
  </li>
  <li>Good for community knowledge-building.</li>
  <li>Inherently self-reflective and more conducive to deep learning.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Students may not know the best approaches and require scaffolding.</li>
  <li>Students may feel disconnected.</li>
  <li>Students do not get instant feedback or responses to question.</li>
  <li>Students may not be motivated.</li>
</ul>
