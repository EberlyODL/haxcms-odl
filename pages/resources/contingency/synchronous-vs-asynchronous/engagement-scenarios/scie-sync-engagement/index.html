<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Affordances</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Students can be engaged in real-time discussions, practices, and
    opportunities to instruct others around the content.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students can seek help and ask questions about the content from instructors
    and their peers.
  </li>
  <li>Students can work and learn in groups for particular assignments.</li>
  <li>
    Interactivity with content can be facilitated with various digital tools
    including digital whiteboards, screen sharing, polling systems, or chat
    spaces.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students who interact with content during live instruction can receive
    immediate feedback.
  </li>
  <li>Most similar to the experience of face-to-face instruction.</li>
  <li>
    Live sessions can be recorded and shared later for students who may have
    missed class or for students who want to go back and review concepts.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Not all students may be available at the same time to interact with the
    content.
  </li>
  <li>There may not be enough time to accomplish complex activities.</li>
  <li>
    Instructors may need to learn how to use certain tools to facilitate
    student-content interactions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Instructors may not be comfortable facilitating active learning sessions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Learners may not have much control over or flexibility with content that is
    delivered in a synchronous setting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students and instructors may not have the time or motivation to learn tools
    used to deliver course content.
  </li>
  <li>Students may choose not to engage with content.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Instructional Strategies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>In-class discussions:</strong> Set up specific times for students to
    have a discussion with other students around a topic of the day. Discussions
    will allow students to converse with each other over the topic. If one
    doesn’t know the content well, the other student could end up teaching or
    they could end up co-creating new knowledge. Teaching others is one of the
    best ways to reinforce learning.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Ideas for in-class discussions</strong> (Angelo & Cross, 1993):
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Muddiest point:</strong> What was the most unclear or confusing
      point in the lecture or the reading?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Minute conversation:</strong> What was the most important thing
      you learned during this class? What important question remains unanswered?
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Punctuated Lecture:</strong> Students briefly reflect then restate
      the most important elements of the lecture.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Relevant topic discussions:</strong> Record a short video lecture
      in advance and ask students to come to class prepared to ask questions or
      discuss the recording. Sticking to “stable” topics will allow you to reuse
      videos for future courses.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are using Zoom, you could create breakout rooms for students to
      “step outside the class space” to have a conversation.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Encourage students to schedule phone calls, chat sessions, or web meetings
    during the allotted class time.
  </li>
  <li>Other online discussion tools include:</li>

    <strong>Online debates:</strong> Debates stimulate critical thinking and can
    be a highly effective way to actively engage students in research in the
    online classroom (Shaw, 2012).

    <strong>Quizzes/live-polling:</strong> Zoom polls or other quizzing tools
    can be used to engage students and assess their knowledge on the topic of
    the day’s lesson.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Create an icebreaker to encourage conversation or engagement for your
      daily topic.
    </li>
    <li>Let your students pick what you are going to discuss.</li>
    <li>
      Get input on the topic. Create a scale question that lets students rate
      their level of understanding on the topic for the day.

    <strong>Social Media:</strong> Encourage students to live-tweet a class
    lecture.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Live-tweeting is engaging on Twitter during an event by sending a series
      of tweets on various aspects of the event as it unfolds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Students can share and elaborate on topics of interest, reply to
      questions, and interact with others.

    <strong>Experts in the class:</strong> Bring in experts for live
    question-and-answer sessions around a particular topic. If you have a
    colleague who is an expert on a topic that you are covering in class, ask
    them to join you during class so students can hear what he or she has to say
    and ask them questions.

    <strong>Worked Problems:</strong> Provide students worksheets with problems.
    Students could do work in advance and then review their answers during class
    time with the class or small groups or they could work in tandem with you as
    you discuss solutions. Students could share their screens to show their
    process for solving problems.
