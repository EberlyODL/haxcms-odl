<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Affordances</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    In a synchronous course, students are able to ask questions in real-time so
    there is no waiting for a response from the instructor or their peers.
  </li>
  <li>
    When students are learning together they feel a stronger connection to their
    peers and a greater sense of community.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students become more engaged in their learning when they are able to connect
    synchronously and be actively engaged.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students may feel a stronger sense of collaboration when they work together
    in a synchronous environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students obtain feedback and suggestions from their peers on their work and
    their discussions in real-time when they participate in a synchronous class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Synchronous classes provide students with an opportunity to interact with
    their peers so that they do not feel so isolated.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Some students may not feel comfortable engaging with the class using
    technology.
  </li>
  <li>
    Obtaining or providing real-time peer feedback may feel daunting to students
    and they may refrain from wanting to participate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some students may not attend classes on a consistent basis and therefore
    miss out on the peer interaction, engagement, and collaboration activities
    the instructor is providing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students are isolated until the next session/next time to interact with the
    class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Due to varying areas of the country and the world, technical difficulties
    are possible either at the student or instructor level which can prevent
    students from connecting with each other.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students may not have a designated and quiet space to connect to the class.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Instructional Strategies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Reciprocal Teaching</strong> can be done with students teaching a
    concept instead of the instructor. The “teachers” can focus on summarizing,
    questioning, clarifying, and predicting through their “lesson” with the
    class. The “teachers” can use the whiteboard in Zoom or use a PowerPoint
    slide with its engagement tools/functions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cooperative learning</strong> instructional strategies promote the
    distribution of various levels of knowledge where students collaboratively
    work together to conduct research, share their results, and perform or
    produce a final project. The use of cooperative learning strategies creates
    a collaborative community of learners.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Structured Discussions:</strong> Students engaging in different
    forms of discussions strengthens their listening and speaking skills. Making
    a class more engaging and challenging through discussions essential to
    student learning.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Socratic Circle/Seminar</strong> can be used by providing an
      open-ended question and having students continue the conversation by
      providing textual evidence to support their claims.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gallery “walks”</strong> can be recreated by assigning students to
      breakout rooms with a link to a Google Doc where the projects or documents
      are located. Students can answer the prompt, question, or provide feedback
      as a group.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Structured academic controversies</strong> provide students the
      opportunity to learn about controversial topics which can be discussed
      from multiple perspectives and then seek consensus
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Think-Pair-Share</strong> can be used without much planning and
    students are able to connect via a breakout room and then regroup with the
    whole class to share the thoughts from their discussion.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>One Burning Question</strong> from each student can be asked to the
    whole class or small groups after students have read their text, article, or
    viewed a video. What did they find they still have a burning question about?
  </li>
  <li><strong>Quizzes:</strong></li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Group or partner developed quizzes</strong> can be beneficial as
      they both support the collaborative process. Students can break into
      groups and come up with a multiple-choice quiz or exam questions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Group Quizzes</strong> can be given at the beginning of class as a
      review of content or at the end of class to summarize learning using the
      breakout rooms in Zoom. The grades can be for low points.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Games</strong> such as Jeopardy can be used to encourage
    participation during the reviewing of concepts, practicing for an exam or
    quiz, or building student vocabulary. Students can work in groups or as
    partners to compete against others and answer questions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Peer Reviews</strong> can be an important part of learning. It
    enhances students’ critical thinking skills and students are able to benefit
    from other students (their peers) reviewing their work and providing
    constructive feedback and suggestions. Instructors can allow student reviews
    to be anonymous if necessary as students do write better feedback when they
    are able to write anonymously.
  </li>
</ul>
