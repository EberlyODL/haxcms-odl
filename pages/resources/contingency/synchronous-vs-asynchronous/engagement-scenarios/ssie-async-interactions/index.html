<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Affordances</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Asynchronous online discussions bridge the gap of social interaction to
    construct, apply, and develop knowledge while enabling students to textually
    communicate, interpret, reflect, and learn with their peers (Tibi, M. H.,
    2016).
  </li>
  <li>
    The asynchronous nature enables students to interact across time and
    location preferences, therefore offering more equitable learning experiences
    for a diverse student population.
  </li>
  <li>
    Online discussions support collaboration in both small-group and all-class
    discussions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Asynchronous online discussions afford students a more active and reflective
    learning experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    Research has shown that group learning helps build active students rather
    than passive recipients of teaching; it helps distribute cognitive load
    among group members through the exchange of ideas (Ikpeze, C., 2007).
  </li>
  <li>
    Student-Student asynchronous activities encourage student-centered learning,
    which enables students to be active in their knowledge transformation and to
    apply their personal experiences, beliefs, values, and practices within
    their discipline.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Students often report a sense of isolation in online learning environments.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students are challenged to establish interpersonal contact with other
    students and to form a community of learners through asynchronous means.
  </li>
  <li>
    Written communication skills are critical for students to articulate their
    knowledge and their needs (Heiser & Ralston-Berg, 2019).
  </li>
  <li>
    Canvas all-class discussions and group discussions can be challenging to
    navigate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Discussion forums require instructor moderation to ensure students are
    engaging in constructive collaboration and healthy discourse.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Instructional Strategies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Identify your expectations on how students should engage in asynchronous
    discussion spaces by offering social respect, sharing personal and social
    information, creating safe and open learning spaces, establishing social
    identity, and developing authentic intimacy. Community Groundrules is an
    Open Educational Resource (OER) that can be utilized in your course to
    articulate your expectations at the start of the semester.

    >
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlike face-to-face learning environments, effective online learning
    environments must rely on instant messaging functions like <strong>Microsoft Teams</strong>,
    audio and video media technologies like <strong>FlipGrid</strong> or <strong>VoiceThread</strong>, email
    correspondence like <strong>Canvas Inbox</strong>, and discussion boards like <strong>Canvas</strong>, <strong>Yammer</strong>,
    <strong>Packback</strong> or <strong>Padlet</strong> as communication platforms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Facilitate a learning community: it’s not the instructor’s sole
    responsibility to carry the discussion; it encourages students to actively
    and thoughtfully participate to improve the collective knowledge of the
    class (Garrison, Anderson & Archer, 1999).
  </li>
  <li>
    Discussion forums should be assessed as quality over quantity and can be
    employed as a course artifact that demonstrates a student’s knowledge
    transformation to meet course objectives (Heiser & Ralston-Berg, 2019).
  </li>
  <li>
    Encourage Student-Student interaction through four dialogue strategies that
    they can employ in their discussion reply posts to promote critical
    thinking:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>conversational (cooperative and seeking mutual understanding);</li>
    <li>inquiry (answering a question and coming to a resolution);</li>
    <li>debate (critical questions with a need for agreement);</li>
    <li>
      and instruction (utilizing questions and statements to come to resolution)
      (Burbules, 1993).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    In an introductory lesson to your course, create a practice discussion forum
    for students to introduce themselves to the class and to familiarize
    themselves with the discussion tool.
  </li>
  <li>
    In addition to practicing discussion forums in an introductory lesson,
    develop informal learning spaces like a student lounge or a class cafe to
    enable students to connect or collectively resolve course-related issues
    (i.e. sharing a lesson reading that another student wasn’t able to access)
    (Sacky, Nguyen, & Grabill, 2015).
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop open-ended, problem-based discussion prompts that challenge students
    to think deeply about the course content and make meaningful connections
    (Heiser & Ralston-Berg, 2019).
  </li>
  <li>
    When creating small groups, try to select group members that are diverse in
    skills and knowledge and limited in size (3 low, 6 high, and 5 ideal)
    (Akcaoglu & Lee, 2016).
  </li>
  <li>
    Groups need clear goals and should be enabled to have the autonomy to
    self-regulate and define norms within the framework provided by the
    instructor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Groups can collaborate to develop final projects, case studies,
    presentations, or papers by utilizing <strong>Box</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Office 365</strong>, or <strong>GSuite</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are many ways to encourage Student-Student interactions in
    asynchronous learning spaces, including book clubs, debates, and Canvas
    supported peer-review exercises.

  </li>
  <li>
    The efforts happening in a group should not be siloed from the rest of the
    class, instead tie the group work back to the all-class discussions to
    present how each group is contributing to the shared body of knowledge.
  </li>
</ul>
