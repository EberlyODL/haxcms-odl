<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Affordances</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Synchronous class sessions can provide a more natural way to instill a
    feeling of connection between instructors and students since the instructor
    and student are engaging in real-time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Many face-to-face strategies that are used to strengthen the
    instructor-student relationship can be easily replicated in the synchronous
    online environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Feedback can be immediate as the instructor can inform students in
    real-time.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Some students might not have the necessary technology (like a webcam) or
    internet connection to engage synchronously.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some students might not be comfortable with sharing their video feed with
    the entire class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Incorporating a lot of back and forth interaction during a live class
    session can lead to time-consuming navigational/logistical problems, so
    prior planning is essential.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Instructional Strategies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Encourage students to share their live video.</strong> Seeing one
    another can make the online experience feel more like a face-to-face
    interaction.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Requiring video is not, however, recommended, as some students may lack
      the technology to do so.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Incorporate icebreaker activities.</strong> At the beginning of your
    class sessions, use icebreakers to build community and increase comfort with
    communicating in the live online environment.
  </li>

      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Schedule one-on-one or small group meetings.</strong> Between class
    meetings, smaller group meetings with students can help you to get to know
    your students better, check on their learning progress, and get a sense of
    how things are going for them in the online environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Incorporate live activities like polls and games.</strong> Adding
    elements like these during your live session can help you gauge whether
    students are “getting it.”
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Use built in Zoom Polls</li>
    <li>
      Use built-in response tools in systems like Zoom, such as the “Yes” or
      thumbs-up button (as in “Click the YES button if you’re following along so
      far”).
    </li>
    <li>
      Add gaming elements to create engaging real-time learning activities.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Examples like Kahoot (a Jeopardy-like online game) and Nearpod
        (interactive slideshow tool).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Use breakout rooms.</strong> Breakout rooms in applications like
    Zoom can give you a way to work with your students during small group
    activities and group projects.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure you provide them with concrete tasks and deliverables</li>
    <li>
      Ask for report-outs when everyone is back together in the main room to
      keep them on track
    </li>
    <li>Manage breakout rooms</li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Incorporate multimedia and visuals.</strong> Adding visual elements
    during your live sessions canto increase student engagement with you and
    your content.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Share popular culture audio or video clips that are related to your
      content, then engage your class in a discussion of how the clips in,
      challenges, or illustrates with what you are studying together.
    </li>
    <li>“Dress the part” to draw attention to your topic(s).</li>

    <li>
      Pre-record your usual lecture, then watch it live with your students
      during your scheduled class time while providing commentary and taking
      time to answer questions along the way.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Tie your topic into current events.</strong> This can help your
    students make important connections between you, the content, and their
    daily lives and experiences.

    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Ask your students for help.</strong> By asking them for help with
    the technology or to lead discussions, monitor chat space, etc., you are
    letting them know that you are all in this together and that you want them
    to feel empowered in the online space.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      This can take a great deal of pressure off of the students (who might also
      be struggling in the online environment) and increase attendance and
      create a willingness to reach out to their instructor and fellow students.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Draw out students who aren’t participating.</strong> During live
    sessions, call on students you haven’t heard from to engage them, just as
    you would in the face-to-face environment.

  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Use the chat area and non-verbal feedback tools.</strong> To better
    engage your students, show them how to use the built-in tools in systems
    like Zoom, ask questions, react, make comments, interject, etc.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have someone in the class or a TA monitor the chat space and take periodic
      breaks to address questions or comments that have been posted
    </li>
    <li>
      IncorporatePackback, a tool approved by Penn State that works like a
      discussion forum, but students generate and answer each other’s questions
      and the instructor can go in and make comments. Use it alongside your
      synchronous class meeting or have them use Packback before your live
      session to generate questions as a springboard for live conversation.<a
