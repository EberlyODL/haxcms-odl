<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Affordances</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Asynchronous interactions for students and instructors offer flexibility in
    scheduling so that engaging the course can happen during convenient blocks
    of time for all parties involved.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is greater opportunity for instructors and students to reflect on
    their participation and prepare more thoughtful responses in asynchronous
    discussion forums.
  </li>
  <li>
    Asynchronous discussion environments may be less threatening for some
    students and thus support richer collaborative experiences and co-creation
    of knowledge (Zhong & Norton, 2018).
  </li>
  <li>
    Communication can be more widely and evenly distributed in the learning
    environment with more opportunities for participants to respond to each
    other.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assignment feedback is an essential feature in asynchronous interactions
    with students and offers both students and instructors evidence of student
    progress in an asynchronous environment.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Feedback lacks immediacy and therefore it takes longer for the feedback
    cycle to complete: submission > instructor feedback > student review >
    revision.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students and faculty may feel less engaged without a regular, physical
    meeting time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Written and nonverbal communications lack nonverbal cues and can be
    misinterpreted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Information must be organized more thoughtfully so students can access
    learning materials without direct intervention.
  </li>
  <li>
    Discussion boards can be long and difficult to engage specific ideas and
    students. The amount of text information to process is much higher in an
    asynchronous environment creating a higher cognitive load for students which
    takes more time to encode and process.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Instructional Strategies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Provide a consistent interval to communicate with students so that they can
    form an expectation of when they will hear from faculty.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have a new announcement at a regular interval for your class. That
      includes reminders of topics addressed, due dates, etc., as well as what
      students can expect from faculty (availability, feedback on assessments,
      etc.). Choose a timeframe for when students should expect feedback from
      assignments and stick to it. Make sure that this feedback is given so
      students have enough time to incorporate feedback into the next assignment
      that is due.
    </li>
    <li>
      Offer students a clear expectation for when you will respond to emails –
      usually within 24 hours is recommended.
    </li>
    <li>
      One student comments: “Couldn’t agree with this more. Also, from my
      experience I’ve received emails, yet no Canvas notifications and vice
      versa. So I’d strongly encourage teachers to use both and all means
      consistently.”
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Active discussion participation is essential to maintaining visible
    instructor presence in the class (Garrison & Akyol, 2013).
  </li>
  <li>Model the kind of interaction you are expecting of your students.</li>
  <li>
    Highlight strengths of discussion posts and spur the discussion with
    questions to expand participation (Garrison & Akyol, 2013).
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a detailed syllabus and maintain those stated expectations throughout
    the course: explicitly communicate any changes when they are made.
  </li>
  <li>
    Include in announcements and other communications what students need to
    expect for a given learning unit and any information to help them navigate
    the course and find what they need for each assignment.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Include any general impressions you might have from an assignment you have
      just assessed to guide students in their performance to improve as the
      course progresses. Trends you see in feedback to individual students are
      often helpful if included in announcements to the entire class.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Consider using audio or video feedback for assignments to build more nuanced
    social presence (Garrison & Akyol, 2013).
  </li>
  <li>
    Offer synchronous office hours, but consider students in different time
    zones and have various meeting time options. Consider office hours by
    appointment. Microsoft bookings, Doodle polls, and Canvas schedule tools
    might help.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider using video introductions so that students get to know you on a
    more personal basis.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider breaking class discussion forums into randomized groups in Canvas.
    Randomized discussion groups each week ensure all students have an
    opportunity to interact with each other.
  </li>
</ul>
