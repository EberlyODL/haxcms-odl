<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Affordances</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Students are able to complete their e-learning activities on their own time,
    at their own pace, from any device, from anywhere in the world.
  </li>
  <li>
    Well-designed courses can remain interactive regardless of location & time
    barriers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Asynchronous technologies support learning and allow more time for student
    reflection, collaboration, and student-to-student interactions (Higley,
    2013).
  </li>
  <li>
    Asynchronous discussion forums nurture higher-order thinking allowing
    students more time to reflect on what has been written and do research
    before responding; hence their written responses are generally considered
    more thoughtful and are more likely to incorporate different perspectives
    and complete tasks fully. (Zhong & Norton, 2018). >An asynchronous learning
    approach can help introverted students eliminate social anxiety, as learning
    in isolation can make them feel safer and more comfortable.
  </li>
  <li>
    The value of the content is found both in its instructional purpose and its
    delivery, that is the learning environment participates in the instruction
    (Friesen & Kuskis, 2013).
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Limitations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Asynchronous content delivery can leave students feeling isolated.</li>
  <li>
    Well-designed and engaging course materials benefit from designer/faculty
    collaboration; the creation of these materials requires significant time and
    resources.
  </li>
  <li>
    The perception that asynchronous content delivery isn’t “worth” the tuition
    spent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Students often lack time-management skills that may result in poor academic
    performance and even risk of course completion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consideration of accessibility and copyright issues are often not adequately
    addressed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Several subject areas including Arts, Nursing, Medicine, Sciences (and
    related labs) cannot provide online content as effectively, while meeting
    course learning objectives, as they can in a face-to-face educational
    experience.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Instructional Strategies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Establish Consistent Communication:</strong> Instructors should
    provide communication tools and establish/maintain expectations related to
    intervals of communication.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Send emails/announcements at regular intervals for your class.</li>
    <li>
      Offer students a clear expectation for when you will respond to emails –
      usually within 24 hours is recommended.
    </li>
    <li>
      Inform students of your feedback timeframe. What is your turnaround time
      for feedback on assignments? Name it and stick to it!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Organize Content:</strong> Organize content within the learning
    management system in a way that encourages students to work through sections
    of content and related assignments in a prescribed timeframe. This can help
    students effectively manage their time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Use Advanced Organizers:</strong> Within the sections of content,
    faculty can provide advanced organizers for students to utilize note-taking
    while working through the content.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Multi-modal Content Design:</strong> Design content that is
    multimodal audio recordings, videos, audio over graphics, graphics, text,
    and other third-party hypermedia providers (Friesen & Kuskis, 2013).
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Include Demonstrations:</strong> This is a great way to capture
      student interest. Record your demonstration as a video clip or develop a
      document with step-by-step illustrations. Be sure videos are accessible,
      add transcriptions or closed captioning. By publishing your video to sites
      such as YouTube, you can upload transcripts or create auto-captioning and
      edit as necessary (Clinefelter & Aslanian 2016).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong
        >Create Assignments that require Group Work & Presentations:</strong
      >
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provide students with tools for online collaboration, video conferencing
        tools, and/or a platform for brainstorming ideas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Instructors should include detailed directions and create rubrics for
        assignments that can help to guide students.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Quizzes & Exams:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Utilize online testing tools that allow for automated feedback.</li>
      <li>
        For higher-order thinking questions, provide an opportunity for students
        to explain processes, procedures, and concepts in a essay-format
      </li>
      <li>
        Some assessments require handwritten problem-solving. Allow for final
        answers to be input into an online quiz tool and correlating handwritten
        work to be scanned and uploaded for further assessment.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Encourage Online Collaborations:</strong> Build an online presence
      that encourages collaboration and connection within the asynchronous
      environment. This can be accomplished through:
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>weekly video reminders & announcements,</li>
      <li>online office hours,</li>
      <li>pre-recorded, content-related lectures,</li>
      <li>
        personal connection events such as “Theme of the Week” activities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Utilize Asynchronous Discussion Forums:</strong> When used
      effectively, discussion forums provide unique opportunities for students
      to engage with you, each other, and the content. Alternatives to
      traditional discussion boards include blogs, journals, portfolios, Wikis,
      or even social media (Clinefelter & Aslanian 2016).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Problem-Based Learning/Case-Based Learning:</strong> Encourage
    students to learn about a subject through the experience of solving an
    open-ended problem provided in the course content. Throughout this process,
    students can work in groups to solve relevant problems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Online Labs:</strong> Well-designed labs are not impossible in an
    asynchronous distance learning environment. If constructed carefully by
    taking into account the needs and preparation level of students, labs will
    enrich student learning opportunities and aid in delivering the course
    learning objectives.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify online materials that provide quality lab environments.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>

        target="_blank"
        >Example: https://www.labster.com/</a
      >
    </li>
    <li>Make short video clips demonstrating techniques.</li>
    <li>Incorporate virtual simulations.</li>
    <li>
      Create opportunities for “live” meetings between instructor-student(s) via
      chat room, Zoom, etc.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Consider Student Accommodations:</strong> Do a status check – do any
    students require accommodations? Be prepared and remain flexible. Ask for
    assistance to be sure course content is accessible to all of your students.
    Accessibility resources are available at:
