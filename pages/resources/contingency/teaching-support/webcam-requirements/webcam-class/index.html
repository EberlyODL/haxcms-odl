  During regular remote instruction, faculty cannot require students to turn on
  their webcam, and should adopt a camera-optional practice for teaching through
  Zoom. A camera-optional approach respects student issues such as equity (e.g.,
  some students may not have cameras on their devices), safety and security
  (e.g., some students may be deployed on active military service, or in need of
  safety or privacy), and religious beliefs.
