  To protect the integrity of exams and other assessments, faculty may require
  students to turn on their webcams in order to monitor the assessment, however
  faculty must notify students of their intent to record the assessment at least
  three days in advance of any recording and, due to PA Wiretap Act, must be
  remind students of the plan to record immediately before any recording takes
  place. Students should, if possible, find a location in which they can access
  a webcam or create a secure location. If students do not have access to a
  camera or have concerns that prevent them from being able to use a camera, the
  student must make the faculty member aware of these concerns at least 48 hours
  before the time of the assessment. In such cases, faculty must work with the
  student to provide an alternate exam. Screensharing can also be an option to
  monitor student work if students are in separate Zoom rooms.

  Students who now are in remote classes did not have an expectation that they
  would be recorded, and we therefore need to be more sensitive to this and
  strike a balance between protecting the integrity of the examination process,
  student privacy, and access to resources. There are differences between the
  use of a proctoring tool, such as Examity, and Zoom. With a proctoring tool,
  only the live proctor reviews the video. If prompted by specific behaviors
  that may indicate academic dishonesty, the faculty member may further review
  the video at a later date. When students enroll in online classes, they are
  made aware that webcams and other technologies are part of the course
  delivery. This also includes a notice of recording and use of webcams (due to
  PA Wiretap Act) when it comes to online proctoring.

  For semesters beyond Spring 2020, students will know before enrolling that
  classes will be delivered virtually and that such technologies will be used,
  so expectations around the use of webcams would be communicated in advance.
  However, faculty will still need to carefully balance the use of webcams with
  student privacy and access to resources and will need to make accommodations
  for student who cannot access webcams for such reasons.
