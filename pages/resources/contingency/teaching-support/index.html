<p><em>A Note from CESE Director, Jackie Bortiatynksi</em></p>
<p>
  As active members in the Center for Excellence in Science Education faculty
  community I am calling on all of you.  First, CESE's leadership wants to say
  thanks for all that I know you are currently doing to help support our
  colleagues in transitioning their teaching format to an online environment. 
  Second, I want to ask that you help in the dissemination of information on
  resources the ECoS Office of Digital Learning is sharing with all of our
  faculty.  I know some of you are creating resources for your home departments
  and are already currently with Melissa and her team but if you have not shared
  these materials with them I urge you to do so soon.  Also providing feedback
  to the CESE leadership team (Jennelle, Jackie C., Lynne and me) on how we can
  be of support to your colleagues would be great.  We will be continuing with
  our "Food for Thought" brown bag series in a virtual format but there may be
  other virtual sessions that we can host to help support faculty.  CESE has
  become one of the important hubs of faculty community and so I want to
  leverage that strength to help in getting information and expertise and
  helping to get it dispersed.   All of you are the extensions of CESE in this
  College.   Please let me know how CESE can be of support and please feel free
  to send me ideas anytime.
</p>
<p>Take care and stay healthy,</p>
<p>Jackie</p>

  How do I handle students who are disruptive in my remote class?
</h3>
<p>
  Students who are disruptive in a remote class should be handled in the same
  way that they are in a face-to-face class. You should set clear standards of
  behavior and communicate your expectations. If disruptive behavior occurs you
  should confront the behavior and, if it continues, ask the student to leave
  the class. If the student continues to be disruptive, you should notify your
  unit head and

  with the Office of Student Conduct. Staff in the Office of Student Conduct
  also are available to discuss your concern at

    href="mailto:studentconduct@psu.edu"

</p>
<p>
  We also have developed guidance for students that explains that they will be
  held accountable for disruptive behavior. In addition to being added to the
  FAQ section of

</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">What are class conduct expectations?</h3>
<p>
  All students are expected to behave with respect in classes, no matter the
  format or delivery mode of the class. If you are disruptive in a remote class,
  this will be handled in the same way as in a face-to-face class. Your
  instructor may speak to you about your behavior. If your behavior does not
  change, you may be asked you to leave the class. If your behavior continues to
  be disruptive, a report will be filed with the Office of Student Conduct and
  your behavior will be responded to through the conduct process. Students
  involved in a serious disruption of the learning environment may not be
  permitted to return to class until University procedures have been completed.
