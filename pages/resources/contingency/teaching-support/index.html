<p><em>A Note from CESE Director, Jackie Bortiatynksi</em></p>
<p>
  As active members in the Center for Excellence in Science Education faculty
  community I am calling on all of you.&nbsp; First, CESE's leadership wants
  to say thanks for all that I know you are currently doing to help support
  our colleagues in transitioning their teaching format to an online
  environment.&nbsp; Second, I want to ask that you help in the dissemination
  of information on resources the ECoS Office of Digital Learning is sharing
  with all of our faculty. &nbsp;I know some of you are creating resources for
  your home departments and are already currently with Melissa and her team
  but if you have not shared these materials with them I urge you to do so
  soon.&nbsp; Also providing feedback to the CESE leadership team (Jennelle,
  Jackie C., Lynne and me) on how we can be of support to your colleagues
  would be great.&nbsp; We will be continuing with our "Food for Thought"
  brown bag series in a virtual format but there may be other virtual sessions
  that we can host to help support faculty.&nbsp; CESE has become one of the
  important hubs of faculty community and so I want to leverage that strength
  to help in getting information and expertise and helping to get it
  dispersed.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of you are the extensions of CESE in this
  College.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please let me know how CESE can be of support and
  please feel free to send me ideas anytime.
