  CAPS is offering to all PSU students, undergraduate and graduate, a
  twice-daily drop-in support opportunity. The sessions are called, "Virtual
  Life Hacks" and will run M-F at 10:00am AND 3:30pm for one hour.
</p>
<p>
  Each Life Hacks offers a 20-25 min presentation about the transitions and
  commonly-held feelings and stressors associated with this time of COVID and
  the shift to remote learning. It also offers coping strategies and small group
  discussions with CAPS staff facilitating them.

  really hope this can serve as another mechanism for helping students reduce
  their distress, increase their well-being, and connect with others! It is
  designed for all students, undergrad and graduate, and run by CAPS staff.

<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Study Habits</h3>
<p>
  Students may be feeling a bit overwhelmed and out of control right now. They
  are possibly facing many unknowns and disruptions. As faculty, we want to give
  them practical suggestions that will help them navigate remote learning and
  all the things that go along with it. Most importantly, we want them to know
  that we care about them and their well-being. This tip sheet is a great
  resource to help students to plan and adjust their strategies for learning
  during this disruptive time.
