<p>
  Students may be feeling a bit overwhelmed and out of control right now. They
  are possibly facing many unknowns and disruptions. As faculty, we want to give
  them practical suggestions that will help them navigate remote learning and
  all the things that go along with it. Most importantly, we want them to know
  that we care about them and their well-being. This tip sheet is a great
  resource to help students to plan and adjust their strategies for learning
  during this disruptive time.
