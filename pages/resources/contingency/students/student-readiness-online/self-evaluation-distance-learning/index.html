  While no instrument can predict success in distance learning courses, having a
  clear understanding of your circumstances and how they may influence your
  behavior as you pursue your goals, can be the difference between completing
  the class and not completing the class. Once you are aware of your strengths
  and weaknesses, you can then take steps to cultivate the behaviors that should
  contribute with your educational success.

  This site has a self-assessment that was developed to give you the opportunity
  to assess your skills and identify possible weaknesses that may affect your
  success when taking distance learning classes.
