<p>
  Conveying to students the importance of “integrity” may help them consider all
  the implications involved if they decide to cheat. Focusing on how others feel
  about integrity or view this characteristic may have much more impact than
  discussing penalties or getting caught.
</p>
<p>
  A multi-pronged approach is recommended, utilizing policies and educational
  technology to support faculty in promoting academic integrity across course
  assignments.

<h4 style="font-weight: 400;">Academic Integrity Statement 2</h4>
<p>
  <i>
    Academic dishonesty is not limited to simply cheating on an exam or
    assignment. The following is quoted directly from the “PSU Faculty Senate
    Policies for Students” regarding academic integrity and academic dishonesty:
    “Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and
    deception and is an educational objective of this institution. Academic
    dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing,
    fabricating of information or citations, facilitating acts of academic
    dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations,
    submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing
    the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students.” All
    University and Eberly College of Science policies regarding academic
    integrity/academic dishonesty apply to this course and the students enrolled
    in this course. Refer to the following URL for further details on the
    academic integrity policies of the Eberly College of Science:
    https://science.psu.edu/current-students/integrity/policies. Each student in
    this course is expected to work entirely on her/his own while taking any
    exam, to complete assignments on her/his own effort without the assistance
    of others unless directed otherwise by the instructor, and to abide by
    University and Eberly College of Science policies about academic integrity
    and academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty can result in assignment of “F”
    by the course instructors or “XF” by Judicial Affairs as the final grade for
    the student.

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Edcuational Technology</h2>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Examity / Proctoring</h3>
<p>
  Currently, there is no university-wide supported proctoring service
  for remote classes. World Campus utilizes the Examity proctoring service, for
  a fee. You will need departmental approval to use the Examity service.
</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Examity</h3>
<p>
  Examity is an online proctoring solution that gives students the flexibility
  to take exams remotely. It provides instructors, schools, and students with
  the tools they need to prevent cheating and to preserve integrity of
  assessments.
