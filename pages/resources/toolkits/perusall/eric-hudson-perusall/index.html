    Students are motivated to ask and answer questions through an AI that can
    judge a student's input. For the first week or so, I usually give students
    full credit for their responses regardless of the AI's assessement. In this
    way, they can start to see what their questions and answers need to look
    like in order to receive full credit.

    As an instructor, refrain from making the first comments on a thread.
    Instead, allow students to provide and receive feedback for each other and
    then add your input as needed.
