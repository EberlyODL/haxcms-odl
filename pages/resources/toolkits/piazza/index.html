    I use it as a way of having students answer each other's questions. Rather
    than sending me an email, they post their questions in Piazza. If they send
    me an email question that has any applicability beyond just that individual
    student, I will post it in Piazza and answer it there. In this way, I
    stopped receiving as many individual emails. Beyond that, it's very easy to
    get all of your teachers and LA's in as instructors, and it supports LaTeX,
    which is great.

    Piazza is a space for asynchronous communication. It's a popular choice in
    STEM courses because you can use LeTex and write markdown, so a lot of
    the formatting and things that STEM professors and students are used to seeing are
    already present. So that's the external thing, but it's also nice because it
    integrates Canvas.
    <br>
    When connected with Canvas, Piazza keeps the whole course integrated, it focuses the course around
    content, topics and questions as opposed to being focused around a lesson
    or week. Oftentimes in Canvas discussions, you get done with one lesson,
    move on the next one, and you totally forget about the one before it.
    Whereas now, you have all of the threads available at any time for review.
