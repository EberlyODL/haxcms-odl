    Piazza will not pull your roster, the best way to get your students into
    Piazza is to share the class signup link that will be provided through
    Piazza when you begin your setup. I recommend sharing this link on the
    'Getting Started Lesson' and orientation pages.

    Students can post anonymously. They show up as anonymous to both classmates
    and instructors. I always disable that feature so that students only show up
    as 'Anonymous to classmates, but not to instructors'. In the event a student
    makes an inappropriate 'anonymous' comment, I can see who
    made it.

    Piazza is great for student polls. In fact, you can force a student to
    complete a poll before reading anything else.

  <li>
    Enable 'Duplicate post suggestions'. I always enable this setting because
    it's an AI that's looking for posts that are similar. Any student can
    quickly see questions that someone else asked, know the question has been
    asked already, and see feedback.
  </li>

    'Class at a Glance' (located at the top of your Piazza course page) is a
    great resource that will give you instant feedback on how your Piazza
    discussion is going. You can see things like: How many unread posts,
    unsanswered questions, contributions, responses, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each question has a unique URL. So you can copy this URL and put it in
    another post and it would send a student directly to that question.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make use of the 'Question History' filter. It's important because these
    threads function like a wiki, students can go in and edit their original
    comments. This filter allows you to see the evolution of those edits.
  </li>
  <li>
    Leverage Piazza's ability to 'Require students to have read this post before
    they can create a new post.' This option is under the 'Add this post to
    student's reading lists' menu. This is perfect if you notice students are
    experiencing a similar problem or technical issue that you want to respond
    to, or if you have a general announcement you need everyone to read.
