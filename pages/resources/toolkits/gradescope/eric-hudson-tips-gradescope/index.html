    Be sure students have access to a device with a camera. I've used Gradescope
    for two semesters and I have never had a student that didn't have some way
    of taking a picture of their work. Quality of the image can range widely,
    but there are a number of free apps online and through Adobe (free to Penn
    State students) that can improve quality. Ask students with the best
    submissions which apps they're using, how they're using them, and then share
    that info with your next students.

    Every assignment I do in the class, I use Gradescope, so homework, quizzes,
    even the midterm. At the end of the midterm, they just walk up to the front
    of the room. Scan their exam, upload it into to Gradescope and then they can
    walk away with their original exam.

    Use the templates feature to create consistent assignment experiences.

    Gradescope will automatically group the responses that students make that
    look the same. When it's time to grade, rather than having to grade every
    single assignment, I just grade the groups. If 22 students have the same
    response, you just graded 22 students with a single click.

    Everything is based on an additive or subtracted rubric that can be modified
    as you go. So you can either have your points add up, or if students do make
    certain mistakes, then it's subtracts points off. The rubric also suports
    LaTex.

    It's very easy for multiple people to be grading at the same time. Gradescope will
    just skip over assignments if someone else has a document open; it won't
    let you open it twice at the same time.

    Gradescope is great for group work. I do group quizzes, for example, and so
    when the students submit their work, they just tag everyone in the class who
    was responsible for that assignment and then everyone gets that grade.
