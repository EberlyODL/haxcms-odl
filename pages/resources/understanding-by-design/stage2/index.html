<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Stage Two – Determine Acceptable Evidence</h2>
<p>
  The second stage of backward design has instructors consider the assessments
  and performance tasks students will complete in order to demonstrate evidence
  of understanding and learning. In the previous stage, the instructor
  pinpointed the learning goals of the course. Therefore, they will have a
  clearer vision of what evidence students can provide to show they have
  achieved or have started to attain the goals of the course. Consider the
  following two questions at this stage:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>How will I know if students have achieved the desired results?</li>
  <li>
    What will I accept as evidence of student understanding and proficiency?
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  At this stage it is important to consider a wide range of assessment methods
  in order to ensure that students are being assess over the goals the
  instructor wants students to attain. Sometimes, the assessments do not match
  the learning goals, and it becomes a frustrating experience for students and
  instructors. Use the list below to help brainstorm assessment methods for the
  learning goals of the course.

  <li>Term papers</li>
  <li>Short-answer quizzes</li>
  <li>Free-response questions</li>
