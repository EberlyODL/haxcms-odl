<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Stage One – Identify Desired Results</h2>
<p>
  In the first stage, the instructor must consider the learning goals of the
  lesson, unit, or course. Wiggins and McTighe provide a useful process for
  establishing curricular priorities. They suggest that the instructor ask
  themselves the following three questions as they progressively focus in on the
  most valuable content:
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >What should participants hear, read, view, explore or otherwise
    encounter?</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >This knowledge is considered knowledge worth being familiar with.
    Information that fits within this question is the lowest priority content
    information that will be mentioned in the lesson, unit, or course.</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  <strong>What knowledge and skills should participants master?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >The knowledge and skills at this substage are considered important to know
    and do. The information that fits within this question could be the facts,
    concepts, principles, processes, strategies, and methods students should
    know when they leave the course.</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >What are big ideas and important understandings participants should
    retain?</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >The big ideas and important understandings are referred to as enduring
    understandings because these are the ideas that instructors want students to
    remember sometime after they’ve completed the course.

  The figure above illustrates the three ideas. The first question listed above
  has instructors consider the knowledge that is worth being familiar with which
  is the largest circle, meaning it entails the most information. The second
  question above allows the instructor to focus on more important knowledge, the
  knowledge and skills that are important to know and do. Finally, with the
  third question, instructors begin to detail the enduring understandings,
  overarching learning goals, and big ideas that students should retain. By
  answering the three questions presented at this stage, instructors will be
  able to determine the best content for the course. Furthermore, the answers to
  question #3 regarding enduring understandings can be adapted to form concrete,
  specific learning goals for the students; thus, identifying the desired
  results that instructors want their students to achieve.
