  Stage Three â€“ Plan Learning Experiences and Instruction
</h2>
<p>
  The final stage of backward design is when instructors begin to consider how
  they will teach. This is when instructional strategies and learning activities
  should be created. With the learning goals and assessment methods established,
  the instructor will have a clearer vision of which strategies would work best
  to provide students with the resources and information necessary to attain the
  goals of the course. Consider the questions below:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    What enabling knowledge (facts, concepts, principles) and skills (processes,
    procedures, strategies) will students need in order to perform effectively
    and achieve desired results?
  </li>
  <li>
    What activities will equip students with the needed knowledge and skills?
  </li>
  <li>
    What will need to be taught and coached, and how should it best be taught,
    in light of performance goals?
  </li>
  <li>
    What materials and resources are best suited to accomplish these goals?
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Below are some instructional strategies to try:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Large and/or group discussion</li>
  <li>Interactive lecturing and think-pair-shares</li>
  <li>Flipped classroom</li>
  <li>Cooperative learning (including team-based and project-based learning)</li>
  <li>Guided note-taking</li>
  <li>Guided inquiry for problem-solving</li>
</ul>
