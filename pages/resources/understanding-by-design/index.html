  <i>Understanding by Design,</i>
  is a book written by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe that offers a framework for
  designing courses and content units called “Backward Design.” Instructors
  typically approach course design in a “forward design” manner, meaning they
  consider the learning activities (how to teach the content), develop
  assessments around their learning activities, then attempt to draw connections
  to the learning goals of the course. In contrast, the backward design approach
  has instructors consider the learning goals of the course first. These
  learning goals embody the knowledge and skills instructors want their students
  to have learned when they leave the course. Once the learning goals have been
  established, the second stage involves consideration of assessment. The
  backward design framework suggests that instructors should consider these
  overarching learning goals and how students will be assessed prior to
  consideration of how to teach the content. For this reason, backward design is
  considered a much more intentional approach to course design than traditional
  methods of design.
</p>
<p>
  This teaching guide will explain the benefits of incorporating backward
  design. Then it will elaborate on the three stages that backward design
  encompasses. Finally, an overview of a backward design template is provided
  with links to blank template pages for convenience.
</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">The Benefits of Using Backward Design</h2>
<p>
  <i
    >“Our lessons, units, and courses should be logically inferred from the
    results sought, not derived from the methods, books, and activities with
    which we are most comfortable. Curriculum should lay out the most effective
    ways of achieving specific results… in short, the best designs derive
    backward from the learnings sought.”</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  In <i>Understanding by Design</i>, Wiggins and McTighe argue that backward
  design is focused primarily on student learning and understanding. When
  teachers are designing lessons, units, or courses, they often focus on the
  activities and instruction rather than the outputs of the instruction.
  Therefore, it can be stated that teachers often focus more on teaching rather
  than learning. This perspective can lead to the misconception that learning is
  the activity when, in fact, learning is derived from a careful consideration
  of the meaning of the activity.
</p>
<p>
  As previously stated, backward design is beneficial to instructors because it
  innately encourages intentionality during the design process. It continually
  encourages the instructor to establish the purpose of doing something before
  implementing it into the curriculum. Therefore, backward design is an
  effective way of providing guidance for instruction and designing lessons,
  units, and courses. Once the learning goals, or desired results, have been
  identified, instructors will have an easier time developing assessments and
  instruction around grounded learning outcomes.
</p>
<p>
  The incorporation of backward design also lends itself to transparent and
  explicit instruction. If the teacher has explicitly defined the learning goals
  of the course, then they have a better idea of what they want the students to
  get out of learning activities. Furthermore, if done thoroughly, it eliminates
  the possibility of doing certain activities and tasks for the sake of doing
  them. Every task and piece of instruction has a purpose that fits in with the
  overarching goals and goals of the course.
</p>
<p>
  As the quote below highlights, teaching is not just about engaging students in
  content. It is also about ensuring students have the resources necessary to
  understand. Student learning and understanding can be gauged more accurately
  through a backward design approach since it leverages what students will need
  to know and understand during the design process in order to progress.
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >“In teaching students for understanding, we must grasp the key idea that we
    are coaches of their ability to play the ‘game’ of performing with
    understanding, not tellers of our understanding to them on the sidelines.”
  </i>
</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">The Three Stages of Backward Design</h2>
<p>
  <i
    >“Deliberate and focused instructional design requires us as teachers and
    curriculum writers to make an important shift in our thinking about the
    nature of our job. The shift involves thinking a great deal, first, about
    the specific learnings sought, and the evidence of such learnings, before
    thinking about what we, as the teacher, will do or provide in teaching and
    learning activities.”</i
