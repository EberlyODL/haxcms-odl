<h3>About Examity® and Examity Proctors</h3>
<p>
  Examity® as a whole aligns with The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
  (FERPA). This is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education
  records. Penn State and Examity® take the way data is handled and the
  protection of student information very seriously. In fact, Examity® has a
  FERPA attorney on their advisory board.
</p>
<p>
  Examity’s proctors go through a rigorous process of selection and interviewing
  by a members of Examity's leadership team, background check and comprehensive
  training. Each proctor has a college degree, advanced technical skills, have
  completed online courses and have strong communication skills. Proctors are in
  training for eight weeks before they are allowed to proctor an exam. The
  eight-week new hire proctor training includes proctoring process, data
  management process, data security training, customer service training,
  Examity® software training and training on tools used to perform their
  function as a proctor. The training includes several live simulations by
  senior staff within Examity®.
</p>
<p>
  All proctors are Examity® employees that proctor from Examity® centers, never
  from a remote site. Moreover, every proctored exam is reviewed by Examity’s
  auditing team and feedback from this process is used to support ongoing
  proctor development.
