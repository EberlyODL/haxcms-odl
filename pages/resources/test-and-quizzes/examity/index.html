<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Automated Proctoring</h2>
<p>
    The exam proctoring process is managed through Examity® for all online courses
    delivered through World Campus. Examity® is a company that specializes in
    proctoring exams for many institutions of higher education. (For all
    University Park web-based course sections that have proctored exams, the
    management of the proctoring of exams is the responsibility of the
    instructor.)

    Below are resources guides for getting started with Examity Automated Proctoring for instructors and user guides for
    students.

      >Examity has a learning curve. Using it the first time for the most important exam will
      cause stress among students. Many students will fail to run the examity software either
      because they don't meet the technical requirement or don't read/follow instructions.
      Failure to launch Examity happens more often with the automated option because there
      is no one to help out. Examity has tech support but I can't imagine how they will do this
      with 1000 + students taking the exam in same day. I outline other concerns in the PDF below.

    >I have
    used live proctoring (a person watches them) for my World Campus courses.
    What is being offered to us at this time is an automated option. More info
    is below. I would just caution that this is one more layer of complexity to
    an already complex situation. There are also several system requirements
    noted below. Jackie and I are going to experiment with quizzing via Zoom,
    a platform all our students are familiar with since we hold our
    live class sessions there. We have surveyed our students as well to know
    what technology access they have.
