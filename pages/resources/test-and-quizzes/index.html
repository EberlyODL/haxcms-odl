    Encourage your students not to use Safari for taking exams or quizzes when
    they include images as part of your exam. We have had reports recently from
    several students about issues of images failing to load.

  Our college encourages faculty to consider a mixed approach when building
  assessments and considering different strategies when requiring students to
  demonstrate various levels of understanding and knowledge. There are a number
  of things to consider when creating assessments and considering academic
  integrity. We are finding faculty who are having the most success are those
  who are using a multi-pronged approach.

  Considerations for a Multi-Pronged Approach
</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Conduct a student needs assessment. What kind of technology do students have
    access to? What is their internet service like? Do they have things that may
    interfere with their test-taking abilities? Here is a sample survey that has
    been used by some faculty to figure out in advance what challenges may be
    faced during an assessment.

  </ol>
  <li>Turn on Canvas Quiz Log</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      Canvas Quiz log is a tool that can be turned on for each of your Canvas
      that will help you identify if students are navigating away from the
      Canvas space during quizzing.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <li>
    As part of your exam or quiz, ask your students to review and complete an
    Academic Integrity Quiz or agreement
  </li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      Example:
      <a
        style="text-decoration: none; color:#e2801e;"

        >Academic Integrity Agreement/quiz</a

  <li>Use

    >Zoom Rooms
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>Mix the types of Questions</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>
      Some faculty start out with retention questions that are multiple choice
      and then add a few questions later that test transfer through short
      response or essay.

    <li>Leverage Canvas Quiz functionality</li>

      Have students generate material, such as a paper, project, or even a video
    </li>
