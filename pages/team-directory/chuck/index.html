  My name is Charles Lavera; I am a Multimedia Specialist / Web Developer with
  the Office of Digital Learning (ODL) at the Eberly College of Science at Penn
  State. Originally from the Pittsburgh area, I uphold a broad background in
  digital-media and web-development with a focus on Drupal-installations, web
  component architecture, interactive content (H5P), and open-source technology.

  You could say that I wear many hats, but I consider my flexibility to be my
  greatest asset as I am able to provide support in a number of areas when
  needed. My favorite part of working with the ODL team has been the opportunity
  to collaborate with faculty and staff to create engaging web-experiences that
  showcase innovation and modern web-advancements. From complete websites to
  custom course-applications, we have fun exploring the deepest recesses of our
  creativity while we build a better future.

  Outside of the office, I am known for being a loving husband, dedicated
  musician, an avid hockey fan, and a nature enthusiast.
