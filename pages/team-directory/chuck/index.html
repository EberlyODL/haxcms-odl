  My name is Charles Lavera; I am a Programmer/Analyst with
  the Office of Digital Learning (ODL). Originally from the Pittsburgh area, I
  uphold a broad background in
  digital-media and web-development with a focus on Drupal-installations, web
  component architecture, open-source technology, and interactive content.

  My favorite part of working with the ODL team has been the opportunity
  to collaborate with faculty and staff to create engaging web-experiences that
  showcase innovation and modern web-advancements.

  Outside of the office, I like spending time with family and friends, playing hockey /
  guitar, and enjoying nature.
