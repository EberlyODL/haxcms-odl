  My name's Sey Yeaple and I am a digital artist, that specializes in 3d work. I
  am a senior at Penn State majoring in Digital Art Media and Design (DAMD),
  formally known as IDS (Interdisciplinary Digital Studios). I work for the
  Office of Digital Learning (ODL) at Eberly College of Science at Penn State. I
  primarily work on creating 3D assets (modeling/texturing), 3D scans, animations,
  and video compositing. I am proficient in Adobe Creative Suite and 3D
  programs including: Blender, Maya, Substance Painter, Unreal Engine (gaming),
  Marvelous Designer, Medium(VR), and 3D scanning (using Artec 3d). I am
  fortunate to have been granted the opportunity to work with the ODL team and
  the new and fun advancements the team is working on.
