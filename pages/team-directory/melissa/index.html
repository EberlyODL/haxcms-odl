  That 400-page training manual…Do you like to chew wood? Those 200-slide
  presentations with 15 bullet points per page and 10 point font…Death by
  PowerPoint? By the end of the course, students will ‘understand’…But, how will
  they ‘show’ you? Accessibility? Copyright? I’m here to help you. Really. I
  can. You just need to trust me. I don’t bite. I’ve been doing this officially
  for over 10 years, but really, as an eternal student, former business owner,
  and mom, I’ve been doing this for all of my adult life. If you think about it,
  life boils down to instructional design. You have to figure out what you need,
  set your goals, design and develop a plan, leverage the most efficient and
  effective tools, provide the most informative and engaging content, execute,
  and then make sure you’re going where you want to go and modify as you see
  fit. Right? Teaching and learning--just the same.

  Armed with skills, knowledge, an awesome team, and a toolbox full of cool (and
  educational) things, I’m your right-hand ID--ready to make you and your
  content shine. People who work with me value my technical savvy and knowledge
  regarding educational tools and feel empowered after learning how to leverage
  them on their own. I value the rapport I build with my colleagues and enjoy
  brainstorming new ways to engage and encourage students. I believe in
  openness, collaboration, supporting local talent (as opposed to paying for
  corporate vendors), working hard, working smart, and chocolate chip cookies.

  When I’m not blazing a trail on social media, you can find me managing a local
  adult baseball team (the Lemont Ducks), spoiling my basset hound, spending
  time with my family, taking photos of everything I cook or grow, and trying to
  dig up information on the next or current ‘big thing.’

  If there’s something you need: ask. If there’s something I can do: I’ll do it.
  If there’s something I don’t know: I’ll find it. I have a world of
  information, people, and tools at my fingertips, and I’m not afraid to use
  them. Stop by, let’s chat, there’s a lot of great things out there waiting to
  be done. Let's do them.
