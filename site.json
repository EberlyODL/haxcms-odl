Weekly labs include discussion of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, an activity to illustrate the phases of the moon, analysis of the colorful spectra of different chemical elements, and exploration of the deepest image of space ever obtained. In addition, students will complete a semester nighttime observation project that typically involves learning some constellations, tracing phases of the moon, and sketching images seen through our well-equipped rooftop student observatory.",

The great success of the Big Bang theory in explaining the expansion of the Universe, the synthesis of the chemical elements, and the relic radiation leftover from the first moments are reviewed. This is a general education class designed for the non-science students who, after learning the fundamentals of astronomy in Astro 001(GN), 005 (GN) or 010 (GN), want to pursue further the questions of cosmology. The material is presented mostly at a qualitative level. The intended outcome of the course is an appreciation of what we know about the Universe, what the current limits to our understanding are, what the process by which we know and test this is, and what we hope to learn in the future.",

During this course, we will explore such evidence and observations. ASTRO 140 is for students who are interested in enriching and broadening their understanding of modern science.

This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of human physiology for students in a variety of life science-related majors including Nursing, Kinesiology, Athletic Training, and Science. Throughout the course, students will obtain a working knowledge and understanding of basic human physiology, apply these physiological principles to problem solving situations as observed in medical situations, including cardiac problems, hypertension, renal failure, acid-base balance disturbances, and endocrine imbalances, and obtain a practical understanding of physiology which you can build upon and use in future clinical settings. Physiology is not an easy subject to learn because it contains a tremendous amount of information. It is, however, a logical science and can usually be understood with reasoning.

The main goals of Chem 101 are for you to gain a solid foundation of the principles of chemistry and use these principles to better understand your observations of the real world. Along the way, you will improve your observation skills and your ability to think critically about your observations. Doing experiments will help you learn good laboratory techniques in taking measurements properly, recording data carefully, and working safely. Using your experimental results, you will learn to analyze and draw logical conclusions from your data. Then you can connect what you observe in the lab with what you have read in the text and practiced in the online activities. The last step is to connect your observations in the lab and class with the real world. While prior study of chemistry is not required, it is recommended that you have taken at least one class in Algebra.",
