The great success of the Big Bang theory in explaining the expansion of the Universe, the synthesis of the chemical elements, and the relic radiation leftover from the first moments are reviewed. This is a general education class designed for the non-science students who, after learning the fundamentals of astronomy in Astro 001(GN), 005 (GN) or 010 (GN), want to pursue further the questions of cosmology. The material is presented mostly at a qualitative level. The intended outcome of the course is an appreciation of what we know about the Universe, what the current limits to our understanding are, what the process by which we know and test this is, and what we hope to learn in the future.",

It is especially interesting when we include the physiology of diseases, as diseases often represent good illustrations of the system not functioning properly. One of the goals of this course is to develop your ability to understand the more complex scientific and medical advances that are occurring with increasing frequency today.  This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of human physiology for students in a variety of life science-related majors including Nursing, Kinesiology, Athletic Training, and Science. Throughout the course, students will obtain a working knowledge and understanding of basic human physiology, apply these physiological principles to problem solving situations as observed in medical situations, including cardiac problems, hypertension, renal failure, acid-base balance disturbances, and endocrine imbalances, and obtain a practical understanding of physiology which you can build upon and use in future clinical settings. Physiology is not an easy subject to learn because it contains a tremendous amount of information. It is, however, a logical science and can usually be understood with reasoning.

Additionally, they will explore aging as related to specific body systems. Students will have an opportunity to review normal anatomy (structure naming) and physiology (body function) of these body systems as well as drill into the details of both senescence and age-related disease processes.

The main goals of Chem 101 are for you to gain a solid foundation of the principles of chemistry and use these principles to better understand your observations of the real world. Along the way, you will improve your observation skills and your ability to think critically about your observations. Doing experiments will help you learn good laboratory techniques in taking measurements properly, recording data carefully, and working safely. Using your experimental results, you will learn to analyze and draw logical conclusions from your data. Then you can connect what you observe in the lab with what you have read in the text and practiced in the online activities. The last step is to connect your observations in the lab and class with the real world. While prior study of chemistry is not required, it is recommended that you have taken at least one class in Algebra.",

Logic is the symbolic, algebraic way of representing and analyzing statements and sentences. While students will get just a brief introduction to logic, the mathematics used in logic are found at the heart of computer programming and in designing electrical circuits. Problems of counting various kinds of sets lead to the study of combinatorics, the art of advanced counting. For example, if a room has twenty chairs and twelve people, in how many ways can these people occupy the chairs? And are you accounting for differences in who sits in particular chairs, or does it only matter whether a chair has a body in it? These kinds of counting problems are the basis for probability. In order to calculate the chance of a particular event occurring you must be able to count all the possible outcomes.",

The review will include: solving linear equations and inequalities, fundamental concepts associated with quadratic equations, solving equations and inequalities with absolute values and other miscellaneous equations involving rational expressions and radical expressions. An introduction to complex number arithmetic is also included. Additionally, it covers general concepts associated with relations and functions. Topics such as the algebra of functions, function composition and range and domain are studied. The graphical representation of linear and quadratic functions are also presented. The algebraic and graphical representation of circles will also be studied as it pertains to terminology associated with relations in general. Basic graphical transformations are introduced. Polynomial and rational functions are studied in detail. In particular, ideas associated with zeros of polynomials, end-behavior, and graph sketching are discussed. Students will learn about synthetic division, the remainder theorem, the conjugate root theorem, horizontal and slant (oblique) asymptotes, and vertical asymptotes. Finally, exponential and logarithmic functions are studied in detail. Specific skills entail working with the rules of exponents and logarithms and solving exponential and logarithmic equations. Concepts associated with one-to-one functions and the existence of inverses are also studied. Sketching and recognizing the graphical representation of exponential and log functions is included.",

The determinant of a matrix is also introduced; it gives a test for invertibility. In the second part of the course the key ideas of eigenvector and eigenvalue are developed. These allow one to analyze a complicated matrix problem into simpler components and appear in many disguises in physical problems. The course also introduces the concept of a vector space, a crucial element in future linear algebra courses.

                    "description": "In this course, students will learn how derivatives commonly appear in equations used to describe the world. Equations involving derivatives are called differential equations. Differential equations play an important role in modeling the real world. Newton's laws, Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism, Einstein's equations of general relativity, Euler and Bernoulli's beam equation, the Black-Scholes equation from finance, Perelson's viral-dynamics equations in biology, and the million-dollar NavierStokes equations are all differential equations used daily in their respective disciplines. Today, differential equations are one of the fundamental mathematical tools for the study of systems that change over time, and are used in most areas of science, engineering, and mathematics. MATH 250 is an introductory course on ordinary differential equations. Ordinary differential equations are equations that involve derivative of a function with respect to only one variable. The goal of this course is to teach the students some of the elementary techniques in dealing with several fundamental types of equations. Some topics include linear equations involving only first and second derivatives, Laplace transforms, systems of linear equations involving only first derivatives, and phase-plane analysis.",

For a more applied, engineering-oriented approach, try Math 441. This is a mathematics class, and you will be expected to read and do proofs. Students come to this class with a range of backgrounds. This is a second course in linear algebra, and emphasizes proofs and an abstract point of view (understanding vector spaces and linear transformations, not manipulating lists and matrices of numbers).

Specifically, Microbiology 106 looks at the unique nature of microorganisms and their importance to life on earth. Microbes were the first form of life to evolve, and even though different in structure from other forms of living things, many similarities can be found in terms of genetics, metabolism, and the roles they play in nature. Bacteria, viruses, and other forms of microscopic life will be examined in some detail, as will their biological activities both beneficial and harmful.Most people think of microbes in their negative roles: disease, food spoilage, and bio-deterioration. Indeed, we spend a lot of time and resources controlling microbes in our environment and treating diseases they cause. But microbes are found naturally on and within the human body with beneficial effect. They are also important in the production of food, vitamins, drugs, and other useful products. They are used extensively in biotechnology. They have important ecological roles and are essential to the continued existence of life on earth.",

The course demonstrates the use and importance of microbes in everyday life. Instruction begins with the proper handling and visualization of microorganisms. Almost by definition, the vast majority of microorganisms are too small to be seen with the naked eye. Therefore, students must learn the correct use of the light microscope. Instruction in the proper care and maintenance of the microscope is provided. Students prepare and stain specimens using a number of methods designed to characterize microorganisms. The importance of working safely in a laboratory setting is emphasized throughout the course.Many skills are developed in this laboratory course. Aseptic (without contamination) technique is taught and is used to transfer organisms properly from one culture medium to another. A variety of media are used and the reasons for their use are explained. Students also learn how to calculate the number of bacteria in specimens such as water, soil or food. The course demonstrates ways to control microbial growth by means of temperature, osmotic pressure, pH, exposure to ultraviolet light and disinfectants.",
