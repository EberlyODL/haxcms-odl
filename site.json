The great success of the Big Bang theory in explaining the expansion of the Universe, the synthesis of the chemical elements, and the relic radiation leftover from the first moments are reviewed. This is a general education class designed for the non-science students who, after learning the fundamentals of astronomy in Astro 001(GN), 005 (GN) or 010 (GN), want to pursue further the questions of cosmology. The material is presented mostly at a qualitative level. The intended outcome of the course is an appreciation of what we know about the Universe, what the current limits to our understanding are, what the process by which we know and test this is, and what we hope to learn in the future.",

We are all dependent upon and supported by natural systems, without which life on earth could not exist. Policy makers and citizens are urgently needed who can act with an understanding of ecological principles when exercising community responsibilities to handle the environmental problems of our times, such as water use, solid waste management, global warming, energy use, conservation of irreplaceable natural resources, overpopulation, and the preservation of biodiversity. Thus, the purpose of BI SC 003 is to help students prepare for living in the 21st century in a sustainable way. BI SC 003 will help students prepare for living in current and future society's mixture of technology and mythology by presenting ideas and concepts about living systems and their environments. An understanding of biological and ecological principles and their application towards environmental challenges should give students the confidence to be active citizens, conscientious stewards of nature, and actively pursuing a healthy, sustainable community and society.",

It is especially interesting when we include the physiology of diseases, as diseases often represent good illustrations of the system not functioning properly. One of the goals of this course is to develop your ability to understand the more complex scientific and medical advances that are occurring with increasing frequency today.  This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of human physiology for students in a variety of life science-related majors including Nursing, Kinesiology, Athletic Training, and Science. Throughout the course, students will obtain a working knowledge and understanding of basic human physiology, apply these physiological principles to problem solving situations as observed in medical situations, including cardiac problems, hypertension, renal failure, acid-base balance disturbances, and endocrine imbalances, and obtain a practical understanding of physiology which you can build upon and use in future clinical settings. Physiology is not an easy subject to learn because it contains a tremendous amount of information. It is, however, a logical science and can usually be understood with reasoning.

Students will learn important aging terminology, methods of measuring aging, current theories of the aging process, and research models used to study aging. Additionally, they will explore aging as related to specific body systems. Students will have an opportunity to review normal anatomy (structure naming) and physiology (body function) of these body systems as well as drill into the details of both senescence and age-related disease processes. By the end of the course, students should have developed a functional understanding of how our bodies change over time and gained a perspective on major diseases that affect our aging bodies. Ultimately students should understand how long-term, healthy living strategies and interventions, started during young life, can potentially prolong life and add additional healthy years to their lifespan.",

Along the way, you will improve your observation skills and your ability to think critically about your observations. Doing experiments will help you learn good laboratory techniques in taking measurements properly, recording data carefully, and working safely. Using your experimental results, you will learn to analyze and draw logical conclusions from your data. Then you can connect what you observe in the lab with what you have read in the text and practiced in the online activities. The last step is to connect your observations in the lab and class with the real world.

Logic is the symbolic, algebraic way of representing and analyzing statements and sentences. While students will get just a brief introduction to logic, the mathematics used in logic are found at the heart of computer programming and in designing electrical circuits. Problems of counting various kinds of sets lead to the study of combinatorics, the art of advanced counting. For example, if a room has twenty chairs and twelve people, in how many ways can these people occupy the chairs? And are you accounting for differences in who sits in particular chairs, or does it only matter whether a chair has a body in it? These kinds of counting problems are the basis for probability. In order to calculate the chance of a particular event occurring you must be able to count all the possible outcomes.",

MATH 220 will give students the basic tools necessary to analyze and understand such systems. The initial portion of the course teaches the fundamentals of solving linear systems. This requires the language and notation of matrices and fundamental techniques for working with matrices such as row and column operations, echelon form, and invertibility. The determinant of a matrix is also introduced; it gives a test for invertibility. In the second part of the course the key ideas of eigenvector and eigenvalue are developed. These allow one to analyze a complicated matrix problem into simpler components and appear in many disguises in physical problems. The course also introduces the concept of a vector space, a crucial element in future linear algebra courses. This course is completed by a wide variety of students across the university, including students majoring in engineering programs, the sciences, and mathematics. (In case of many of these students, MATH 220 is a required course in their degree program).",

Equations involving derivatives are called differential equations. Differential equations play an important role in modeling the real world. Newton's laws, Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism, Einstein's equations of general relativity, Euler and Bernoulli's beam equation, the Black-Scholes equation from finance, Perelson's viral-dynamics equations in biology, and the million-dollar NavierStokes equations are all differential equations used daily in their respective disciplines. Today, differential equations are one of the fundamental mathematical tools for the study of systems that change over time, and are used in most areas of science, engineering, and mathematics. MATH 250 is an introductory course on ordinary differential equations. Ordinary differential equations are equations that involve derivative of a function with respect to only one variable. The goal of this course is to teach the students some of the elementary techniques in dealing with several fundamental types of equations. Some topics include linear equations involving only first and second derivatives, Laplace transforms, systems of linear equations involving only first derivatives, and phase-plane analysis.",

Bacteria, viruses, and other forms of microscopic life will be examined in some detail, as will their biological activities both beneficial and harmful.Most people think of microbes in their negative roles: disease, food spoilage, and bio-deterioration. Indeed, we spend a lot of time and resources controlling microbes in our environment and treating diseases they cause. But microbes are found naturally on and within the human body with beneficial effect. They are also important in the production of food, vitamins, drugs, and other useful products.

Instruction in the proper care and maintenance of the microscope is provided. Students prepare and stain specimens using a number of methods designed to characterize microorganisms. The importance of working safely in a laboratory setting is emphasized throughout the course.Many skills are developed in this laboratory course. Aseptic (without contamination) technique is taught and is used to transfer organisms properly from one culture medium to another. A variety of media are used and the reasons for their use are explained. Students also learn how to calculate the number of bacteria in specimens such as water, soil or food. The course demonstrates ways to control microbial growth by means of temperature, osmotic pressure, pH, exposure to ultraviolet light and disinfectants.",
