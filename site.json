Therefore, developing an appreciation and understanding of the biological world is important to living in this world and becoming a responsible steward of its resources. Who hasn't watched a bird and wondered what it would be like to be able to fly? To see the world from a different perspective? This course will provide an introduction to fundamental biological topics (including cells, energy transduction, genetics, evolution, organismal structure\/function, ecology) for non-majors in biology-related fields.",

Logic is the symbolic, algebraic way of representing and analyzing statements and sentences. While students will get just a brief introduction to logic, the mathematics used in logic are found at the heart of computer programming and in designing electrical circuits. Problems of counting various kinds of sets lead to the study of combinatorics, the art of advanced counting. For example, if a room has twenty chairs and twelve people, in how many ways can these people occupy the chairs? And are you accounting for differences in who sits in particular chairs, or does it only matter whether a chair has a body in it? These kinds of counting problems are the basis for probability. In order to calculate the chance of a particular event occurring you must be able to count all the possible outcomes.",

MATH 220 will give students the basic tools necessary to analyze and understand such systems. The initial portion of the course teaches the fundamentals of solving linear systems. This requires the language and notation of matrices and fundamental techniques for working with matrices such as row and column operations, echelon form, and invertibility. The determinant of a matrix is also introduced; it gives a test for invertibility. In the second part of the course the key ideas of eigenvector and eigenvalue are developed. These allow one to analyze a complicated matrix problem into simpler components and appear in many disguises in physical problems. The course also introduces the concept of a vector space, a crucial element in future linear algebra courses. This course is completed by a wide variety of students across the university, including students majoring in engineering programs, the sciences, and mathematics. (In case of many of these students, MATH 220 is a required course in their degree program.)",

            "description": "In this course, students will learn how derivatives commonly appear in equations used to describe the world. Equations involving derivatives are called differential equations. Differential equations play an important role in modeling the real world. Newton's laws, Maxwell's laws of electromagnetism, Einstein's equations of general relativity, Euler and Bernoulli's beam equation, the Black-Scholes equation from finance, Perelson's viral-dynamics equations in biology, and the million-dollar NavierStokes equations are all differential equations used daily in their respective disciplines. Today, differential equations are one of the fundamental mathematical tools for the study of systems that change over time, and are used in most areas of science, engineering, and mathematics. MATH 250 is an introductory course on ordinary differential equations. Ordinary differential equations are equations that involve derivative of a function with respect to only one variable. The goal of this course is to teach the students some of the elementary techniques in dealing with several fundamental types of equations. Some topics include linear equations involving only first and second derivatives, Laplace transforms, systems of linear equations involving only first derivatives, and phase-plane analysis.",

It is not a course about vectors, in the sense of lists of numbers, and matrices (for this see Math 220), although we will of course make use of these concepts as needed. This course has a theoretical bent: we want to understand vector spaces and linear transformations, rather than use them to solve specific problems. For a more applied, engineering-oriented approach, try Math 441. This is a mathematics class, and you will be expected to read and do proofs. Students come to this class with a range of backgrounds. This is a second course in linear algebra, and emphasizes proofs and an abstract point of view (understanding vector spaces and linear transformations, not manipulating lists and matrices of numbers). We build up to and use structure theorems for linear operators.",

Microbes were the first form of life to evolve, and even though different in structure from other forms of living things, many similarities can be found in terms of genetics, metabolism, and the roles they play in nature. Bacteria, viruses, and other forms of microscopic life will be examined in some detail, as will their biological activities both beneficial and harmful.Most people think of microbes in their negative roles: disease, food spoilage, and bio-deterioration. Indeed, we spend a lot of time and resources controlling microbes in our environment and treating diseases they cause. But microbes are found naturally on and within the human body with beneficial effect. They are also important in the production of food, vitamins, drugs, and other useful products. They are used extensively in biotechnology. They have important ecological roles and are essential to the continued existence of life on earth.",

The course demonstrates the use and importance of microbes in everyday life. Instruction begins with the proper handling and visualization of microorganisms. Almost by definition, the vast majority of microorganisms are too small to be seen with the naked eye. Therefore, students must learn the correct use of the light microscope. Instruction in the proper care and maintenance of the microscope is provided. Students prepare and stain specimens using a number of methods designed to characterize microorganisms. The importance of working safely in a laboratory setting is emphasized throughout the course.Many skills are developed in this laboratory course. Aseptic (without contamination) technique is taught and is used to transfer organisms properly from one culture medium to another. A variety of media are used and the reasons for their use are explained. Students also learn how to calculate the number of bacteria in specimens such as water, soil or food. The course demonstrates ways to control microbial growth by means of temperature, osmotic pressure, pH, exposure to ultraviolet light and disinfectants.",

Social events in the news where science played a large role such as the Roswell “UFO” event in 1947 or the Fukushima nuclear crisis in 2011 will also be discussed. Students will learn about the scientific method and scientific reporting; the conceptual aspects of the structure of matter from atoms to quarks, waves, energy and light; quantum mechanics and its applications to high tech such as computers and lasers; relativity E=mc2, nuclear forces, gravity and the Big-Bang theory. Particular emphasis will be put on learning the scientific standards for a hypothesis to be truly established as a working theory and how the simple laws of physics apply broadly to many different systems. This class will emphasize conceptual aspects and there is no mathematics prerequisite. This course is for non-science majors.",
