    allows you to create a
    project outline complete with instructions and assessment possibilities. In
    this video, I set up a simple
    demonstration that identifies some basic goals while also asking users to
    supply their insight as they traverse
    through each step. Specifically, we look over the general settings of the
    tool and work through building an
    example that will help users scaffold out a detailed steps-to-completion
    outline, create a plan of attack, and
    organize / assess individual goals and contributions. At the end, we'll
    review the different ways we can
    implement this newly created content into your website. Check it out!

  Michael is an educational technologist who brings a decade’s worth of
  experience building websites and applications to the edtech space. His
  non-traditional path began at Penn State where he earned his BA in Political
  Science. From there, Michael joined a local venture capital group where he was
  involved with many different companies and handled everything from sales, to
  product development, to logistics and shipping. When one such company lost
  their only web developer, Michael was tapped to takeover the programming
  responsibilities and the rest is history. Michael was immediately hooked with
  web development and begin soaking up every piece of information the web could
  offer.
<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
  Since then, Michael has gained a wealth of experience in the full stack of web
  applications. His skillset is most notable in the area of front-end
  development and the Drupal framework. He has a passion for writing code,
  learning how to code, and mentoring fellow programmers. Michael has a unique
  gift for connecting, inspiring, and empowering others.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div>
  Innovative, forward thinking, risk taking are some of the reasons Michael
  wanted to work at ODL. His goal is to create technology and applications that
  remove barriers between educators and students. Michael believes that the web
  can enable people to change their lives for the better.

  I have always been obsessed with visuals. When I was a kid I would go through
  my mom’s magazines, find an image I loved, check with my mom to make sure she
  didn’t need the article on the back, then clip it out and safely tuck it away
  in a flat, waxed-cardboard box under my bed - only to find out years later
  that my mom secretly snuck in my room and downsized my collection to keep it
  under control.
  <br />
  <br />
</div>
<div>
  These days, I apply my passion for visual arts to graphic design and
  photography. I soak up inspiration all around me, and still tear out magazine
  ads and tuck them away for reference. I strive to visually present the facts
  and discipline of science with creativity, quality, technology and whenever
  possible… a bit of humor. I am always looking for new ways to approach
  courses, graphics, and content to successfully visually communicate concepts
  with an audience.

<h2>Proctor Information</h2>
<p>
  You will need to secure a proctor in order to take exams in this course. A
  proctor will not automatically be assigned to you; rather, you must make the
  necessary contacts to secure a professional who will serve in this capacity.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Contact a person who meets the qualifications and ask him or her to proctor
    your exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    Student Services must approve your proctor before any exams can be taken.
    Please see instructions for <a href="https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/courses/proctored-exams">securing a suitable proctor</a>
. While many proctors
    will serve on a voluntary basis, you are responsible for paying any expenses
    incurred in retaining a proctor.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must submit your proctor for approval or schedule your exams at a
    testing center using our online proctored exam portal. You will need to
    enter your proctor's contact information and submit proctor verification
    documentation. Note: If your proctor has been previously approved by the
    World Campus during a prior course within two years, you do not need to
    obtain verification. World Campus retains proctor information on file for
    two years. To learn more about using the online portal, visit the World
    Campus website "<a href="https://student.worldcampus.psu.edu/a-z-index/using-the-proctored-exam-portal">Using the Proctored Exam Portal</a>

      <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Society and Disease Management is an investigation of how infectious diseases
  spread through populations and the economic and societal impacts of these
  diseases. An examination of the biological mechanisms of diseases and how
  disease burden is managed in communities will guide the rational for local and
  global health approaches to managing disease interventions. Class foundations
  include topics from biology, economics, systems theory, and health policy.
  Assessments will incorporate applications from all of these fields.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
  By the end of this course, students should have gained sufficient knowledge
  to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Explain the biological mechanisms by which humans respond to pathogens
    (bacteria, virus, protist) and typical treatment regimens.
  </li>
  <li>
    Summarize the historical biological and cultural context relating to the
    development and use of vaccines and of antibiotics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify the most pressing health issues related to human diseases around
    the globe and evaluate these issues from cultural and economic viewpoints.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assess the present economic and cultural issues related to public health
    management strategies including plausible frameworks for disease prevention
    or containment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Read and evaluate popular scientific, economic, cultural, and news articles
    to make informed decisions relating to their personal health and health of
    the larger community.

<p>
  All readings and other course materials will be provided in our Canvas course.
</p>
<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>
  This course is really one of those "you get out of it what you put into it"
  type of experiences. We do not aim to change your opinions but we do hope to
  help you consider national and international health issues at a deeper level
  than if you had not taken this course. Discussion boards will be a large part
  of this class. There will also be reflection/reaction essays to complete, as
  well as short videos and interactive activities from various websites for
  which you can earn points toward your final point total. We ask you to note
  topics or websites of interest as you research the various topics for this
  course. We strongly encourage suggestions for topics, assignments, and
  projects from you!

  This is a 4 credit course that is fairly intensive with course work due almost
  every day. A standard week contains three phases: exploratory phase, problem
  solving phase and revision phase. The exploratory phase of a giving week
  overlaps with the revision phase of the previous week. The final assignment
  for a week are due on Tuesday of the next week allowing time to review and
  discuss.

<p>
  Most of the material is posted ahead and it is entirely possible for you to
  adjust this schedule to fit better with your own work/study schedule.
</p>
<h2>Reading Quiz</h2>
<p>
  We will be using an online computer grading system called MasteringPhysics

      <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course combines Human Anatomy, which is the study of parts of the human
  body, with Human physiology, which is the study of how parts of the body work
  together to make the body function. It is an introductory course for
  non-science majors, and it is hoped that you will develop a basic
  understanding about the human body that you will find useful when dealing with
  your own or a family member’s injury or illness in the future.
</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>
  All students are expected to complete the weekly assignments on time. These
  will be available for at least one week so budget your time accordingly. You
  are not able to complete all of your work for a month at one time and be done.
  This course is paced so you can progress through at a reasonable speed.
</p>
<p>
  Each week there will be at least one lesson for you to study. Each lesson will
  have one quiz, one homework assignment, and textbook assignment (LearnSmart
  modules, Labs, etc.). Be aware that some weeks there may be more than one
  lesson, thus more than one quiz and homework/textbook assignments. Each of
  these have specific due dates listed on the folder in which you find them.
</p>
<p>
  You may complete the homework and textbook assignments early as they will be
  available from the start of the semester. However, each quiz has a definite
  shelf life. Quizzes are meant to activate on a Saturday and deactivate on the
  following Sunday. That means you have more than a week to complete it. At no
  other time will you be able to view or complete quizzes, it is impossible to
  open up the quiz for a single person. The only exception to this is an
  instance of the quiz being improperly configured. If I short the class on time
  due an incorrect setting I will open up the quiz for additional time and
  everyone will have an opportunity to then complete it. However, that has been
  a rare event (but if it happens, notify the instructor). Pay attention to due
  dates, each assignment has one listed with the folder for that week.
</p>
<p>
  The quizzes are set to overlap so you can manage your schedule if you happen
  to be away from a computer for an entire weekend. If you know that will happen
  then either get things out of the way very early or make it a point to finish
  the following weekend. Missing an assignment should never happen if you manage
  your time properly. You will be entirely responsible for your time and
  scheduling.
</p>
<p>
  The weekly quizzes will be timed so it will not be possible to look up the
  answers to these questions at your leisure. The expectation is that you will
  study the content, gain some level of mastery of the terminology and take the
  tests to see how well you know everything. You are not to have access to
  sources of information when you take these tests, they are not open book.
</p>
<p>
  The homework assignments may be completed ahead of schedule but not after the
  due date. Being late a day or two will result in a late penalty. Homework
  turned in after that will result in a zero. Homework assignments should not be
  copied from any other source, cited correctly or not. Many assignments will
  have you finding information from sources including the internet, however, a
  cut and paste job does not equal effort. Googling information is not
  considered an academic achievement.
</p>
<p>
  Everything you write is expected to be your own work, not something you find
  and copy from the internet. It's perfectly clear when students have
  plagiarized a paragraph from a web page. It only takes 30 minutes to find a
  few web sites about a topic and then write up a summary of what you find.
  Don't risk University sanctions and an F for a homework assignment that should
  take less than an hour. See the statement on academic integrity for further
  information.
</p>
<h2>Late Assignments / Technical Difficulites</h2>
<p>
  Since you have seven days in which to submit homework, and take a quiz, I will
  not accept illness or technical difficulties as an excuse to make up missed
  work. The only exception to this would be an extended hospitalization stay.
  All quizzes and homework message boards are available at the beginning of of
  the course. The due dates listed with each assignment are the last days that a
  quiz or homework assignment is available. To avoid missing deadlines, submit
  your work early and avoid waiting until the last evening at 11:55 pm to submit
  your homework or take a quiz. Your internet dropping out at the last possible
  minute to submit work is not a reasonable cause for being unable to complete
  work in a timely manner. Do not turn in work at the last possible minute. No
  scores will be dropped. Work cannot be turned in for a higher grade once a
  grade is assigned. There will be no opportunities to turn in extra work for
  extra credit. Be prepared to do the necessary work to reach your goals for a
  final grade.
</p>
<h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
<p>
  All course work will be submitted to your instructor through Canvas. To do
  this, you will need to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click on the Modules button in the menu bar at the left of this page</li>
  <li>Choose the folder for the week we are currently in</li>
  <li>Click on the homework assignment for the week</li>
  <li>Type your answer into the text box</li>
  <li>Click "submit assignment"</li>
  <li>
    At the appropriate time click on the quiz for that week and complete it
    within the time specified or it will automatically submit whether you are
    finished or not
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  The Grading Scale can be found in the Getting Started section of Canvas. All
  grades can be found in Canvas by going to the Grades button on the left hand
  side.
</p>
<p>
  Each lesson has a quiz that will vary in length between 10 and 20 points each.
  Some will be longer than others depending on the amount of material covered in
  a particular lesson.
</p>
<p>
  Each quiz question is worth 1 point out of the total. Every question is worth
  exactly the same as any other question; only the length of the quiz each week
  will vary. Do not think in terms of percentage points here, this will be a
  point system based on total points.
</p>
<p>
  Students will work on these assignments as an individual and will be
  responsible for completing them on time. Late assignments will have a
  deduction, assignments more than a couple of days late will not be accepted.
  Once we reach the end of the course it will not be possible to go back and
  complete work that is outdated by weeks or even months. Keep up on assignments
  to gain maximum points.
</p>
<p>
  Grades are based on a combination of quizzes where each question is worth one
  point and various homework assignments worth a handful of points. All students
  are expected to complete the weekly quizzes on time. These will be available
  for at least one week so budget your time accordingly. You are not able to
  take all your tests at one time and be done. This course is paced so you can
  progress through at a reasonable speed.Each homework assignment has a specific
  number of points associated with it.
</p>
<p>
  Any questions concerning a particular quiz or homework assignment must be
  resolved immediately. You cannot wait till the end of the semester to correct
  any problems. Due to time constraints, it will be impossible to review all
  assignments on the last day in the hope of finding one or two points to meet a
  grade cutoff. You should ask that all grading issues be resolved as they occur
  during the semester. No exams will be dropped; no extra credit will be
  accepted. It's impossible to evaluate hundreds of book reports or shoebox
  dioramas.
</p>
<h2>Deferred Grades</h2>
<p>
  Students who are unable to complete the course because of illness or emergency
  may be granted a deferred grade which will allow the student to complete the
  course within the first six weeks of the following semester.
</p>
<p>
  When a request for a deferred grade is supported by the instructor, the
  instructor indicates this approval by recording the deferred grade symbol (DF)
  for the student. The expiration date for the deferred grade is automatically
  recorded as the end of the sixth week of the next semester. Spring semester
  approvals expire during the fall semester unless the student enrolls during
  summer session. Therefore, course requirements must be completed and a grade
  must be submitted by the end of six weeks into the student’s next semester for
  which he or she is registered. Any deferred grade that is not replaced by the
  deadline will automatically become an F.
</p>
<p>
  Note that deferred grades are limited to those students who can verify and
  document a valid reason for not being able to complete the last few
  assignments, not for gaining extra time to complete missing work from earlier
  in the semester. Students are expected to have completed at least 75% of the
  course assignments to be eligible for a deferment. For more information see DF
  grade.

<p>
  Cellular structure and organization; physiological processes; classification;
  reproduction and development; relationship of plant groups. Students who have
  passed BIOL 240W may not schedule this course
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>During the course of the semester, the student will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Develop critical thinking skills, gather credible information, question
    ideas from a scientific viewpoint
  </li>
  <li>Learn and integrate terms and concepts in plant biology</li>
  <li>
    Understand how plant structure (cellular, organismal) and function
    (biochemical) are tied together
  </li>
  <li>
    Learn how plants and humans interact and the outcomes of this interaction
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop laboratory skills to investigate plant evolution, anatomy, and
    physiology
  </li>
  <li>
    Design an experimental approach that addresses a concept in plant biology
  </li>
  <li>
    Summarize, in the style of a scientific journal article, the design,
    rationale, results, interpretation, and conclusions of a scientific
    experiment or studyP
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Required Materials</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Bidlack J., Jansky S., and Stern K. Stern’s Introductory Plant Biology, 13th
    ed. ISBN-13: 978- 0073369440, ISBN-10: 0073369446
  </li>
  <li>
    Carolina Biological Botany Lab Kits Purchase at:
    https://www.carolina.com/carolina-distancelearning-science-kits/the-pennsylvania-state-university-introductory-plant-biology-biol-127/581864.pr
  </li>
  <li>
    Digital camera with ability to upload pictures to Canvas
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Attendance / Participation</h2>
<p>
  You will be expected to check in every day or every other day for any
  announcements or updates. The amount of time spent looking over the material
  typically is correlated with quiz and exam grade: the more time spent studying
  usually translates into a better grade. Although this is an online course, you
  should expect to spend a similar amount of time on the material that you would
  for an inperson class. The general rule for studying is as follows: for every
  one hour of lecture, you should spend 2.5 to 3 hours studying the material.
  That means for a three-credit course, you should spend 7.5 to 9 hours per week
  studying and completing assignments if you intend to do well (“A” or “B”
  level).
</p>
<h2>Labs</h2>
<p>
  You will complete 11 labs related to the material covered during that week.
  The lab materials must be ordered through Carolina Biological Supplies, and
  will be delivered to your home. The labs are designed for you to complete at
  your home, with the exception of one lab, where you will be required to go to
  a local park, arboretum, or botanical garden. Though in some cases the lab
  will reinforce concepts covered in the book and in the PowerPoints, the lab
  may also cover a unique topic. For this reason, material covered in lab
  activities will be included on exams. If you have completed all 11 labs, only
  your 10 best scores will count towards your grade.
</p>
<h2>Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Each week one or more short quizzes covering that week’s chapter contents must
  be completed. The quizzes are designed to ensure that you keep up with your
  reading and study. The quizzes will be in a true/false, matching, or
  multiple-choice type format and are intended to reinforce the main concepts in
  each chapter. Utilize the weekly objectives as a study guide for the quizzes
  and exams. These quizzes will only be open for a limited time, so do not go
  for extended periods of time (days, weeks) without having logged into the
  course. I typically do not re-open quizzes unless in the case of technical
  difficulties from my end. If you miss one or a few quizzes, this will not
  negatively affect your grade. If you have taken all 23 quizzes, only your 20
  best scores will count towards your grade.
</p>
<h2>Video Discussions</h2>
<p>
  During the semester, you will watch two documentaries: The Botany of Desire,
  broken into four parts of 30 minutes each, and America’s Lost Landscape: The
  Tallgrass Prairie which is 60 minutes. This is a total of five discussion
  forums. For each forum, you will be asked to post a response or answers
  questions. Your first post is due 24 hours prior to the due date for the
  assignment. If the post is late, no points will be awarded (see discussion
  instructions in the week 1 module on Canvas for more detailed instructions).
  The discussions are worth 25 points each.
</p>
<h2>Lab Report</h2>
<p>
  One lab will require that you write a formal lab report. This is meant to give
  you practice at scientific writing. You will complete a peer-review draft, a
  rough draft, and a final draft (see the instruction in the Effects of Ethylene
  on Fruit Ripening Lab and the individual Lab Report assignments on Canvas for
  more details).
</p>
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>
  During the semester, you will have three exams and a final exam over the
  material covered. These exams will include true/false, multiple-choice, and/or
  matching questions; in addition there may be diagrams to label and/or short
  free-response questions. Exams will cover material for each “unit”: Exam 1
  will cover material from the beginning of the course until the first exam,
  Exam 2 will cover material after Exam 1 until the second exam, and so forth.
  The final will be similar in format to the midterm exams. The only differences
  will be that the final will be slightly (about 50%) longer, and will be
  cumulative. The cumulative section will be about 33% of the final, and the
  remainder will be material covered after the third midterm. All exams will be
  delivered online, but they will be proctored, using Examity (see Examity
  section under University Policies). You will have a window of about 72 hours
  to take your exam, but you must schedule it in advance through the Examity tab
  in Canvas. If you make changes to your scheduled exam time less than 24 hours
  before the start of the exam window, Examity will charge you a fee of $3.

      <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course is an overview of our current knowledge of human heredity, genetic
  issues, genetic diseases, and human evolution. Background information that is
  necessary for understanding these issues will be taught including cell
  structure, the structure and function of DNA and chromosomes, patterns of
  inheritance, population genetics, human evolution, and genetic technologies.
  This course is intended for non-biology majors and does not include a detailed
  analysis of human genetics. This course will include Canvas readings,
  web-based readings and videos, and web-based interactive exercises. There are
  ample opportunities for individual problem-solving while group assignments are
  offered as discussion forums. Students will also research genetic conditions
  and have the opportunity to share what they have learned.

      <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The human body is fascinating to most of us, presumably because we have a
  rather vested interest in it. It is especially interesting when we include the
  physiology of diseases, as diseases often represent good illustrations of the
  systems not functioning properly. I have tried to include information that
  will both sustain and stimulate your interest, as well as challenge you to
  extend your knowledge outside this course. There are many good programs on the
  Public Broadcasting System and cable TV as well as articles in magazines such
  as Science News, Scientific American, Discover, Scientific American Science
  and Medicine, and Natural History that illustrate the fascinating aspects of
  human physiology. One of the goals of this course is to develop your ability
  to understand the more complex scientific and medical advances that are
  occurring with increasing frequency today.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
  This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of human physiology for
  students in a variety of life science-related majors including Nursing,
  Kinesiology, Athletic Training, and Science. By the time you complete this
  course, you should:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a working knowledge and understanding of basic human physiology.</li>
  <li>
    Be able to apply these physiological principles to problem solving
    situations as observed in medical situations, including cardiac problems,
    hypertension, renal failure, acid-base balance disturbances, and endocrine
    imbalances.
  </li>
  <li>
    Have a practical understanding of physiology upon which you can build and
    use in future clinical settings.
  </li>

  Biology 155 is a 3-credit lecture course designed to give both science and
  non-science majors a basic understanding of the aging process, with special
  emphasis on aging as it relates to the human body and health. The first third
  of the course will discuss important aging terminology, methods of measuring
  aging, current theories of the aging process, and research models used to
  study aging. The later two thirds of the course will review aging as related
  to specific body systems. As such, portions of lessons will review normal
  anatomy (structure naming) and physiology (body function) of these body
  systems. In this later section, details of both senescence and age-related
  disease processes will be discussed.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Upon completion of this course, you will have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed a functional understanding of how our bodies change over time
  </li>
  <li>
    Gained a perspective on major diseases that affect our aging bodies

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  Your course grade will be based upon your performance on the lesson
  assignments and two examinations. The lesson assignments will be 1/3 of the
  final course grade, with the mid-course counting as 1/3 and the final counting
  as the last 1/3. Examinations will have 30 multiple choice, matching and
  true/false questions, worth 80% of the exam points, and the remaining 20% of
  the exam points will be performance on a short essay and term definitions. The
  mid-course exam will stress material developed in lesson assignments 2-7. The
  final exam will stress material developed in lesson assignments 9-14, and will
  not be comprehensive. That said, some broad concepts developed throughout the
  course, could be found in some questions.

<p>
  This course presents a thorough background on the basic structure and function
  of the human reproductive system. Goals are to provide the student with
  sufficient knowledge to understand and discuss sex-related topics and make
  informed personal decisions. Through online presentations and class discussion
  students will be exposed to information that will clarify their understanding
  of the ways that their own body functions in sexual behavior and reproduction.
  Importantly, students will examine the roles of reproductive physiology and
  sexuality in a historical, cultural and social context, with particular
  emphasis on cultural and gender differences in anatomical forms, sexual
  expression, and disease. The course will present current research on human sex
  and reproduction, and explore the biology behind human sexuality and medicine.

  Quizzes consist of 5-10 multiple choice, ordering, multiple select and
  true/false questions based on the weekly lectures and web assignments. These
  will be available in Canvas in the weekly modules folders. You can submit the
  quiz anytime during the week, but you will be given 15-20 minutes to complete
  the quiz and only one attempt. Do not open the quiz until you have viewed all
  the course material for that week. You will be presented with 14 quizzes, but
  only your top 12 quiz scores will be considered in the final grade
  calculation. If you fail to take a quiz in the allotted time for any reason it
  will be counted as one of your dropped scores.

<h2>Discussion Boards</h2>
<p>
  Discussion boards require full class participation. Each discussion board is a
  maximum of 5 points total. Discussion topics are testable on exams and you may
  see exam questions on that material. It is in your best interest to check back
  and read comments throughout the week. Posting to the discussion board after
  the due date when classmates are no longer engaging is pointless (there is no
  one else logging on to discuss) and therefore worth 0 points. I do not accept
  late discussion posts under any circumstances. Discussions cannot be reopened
  after they close for any reason including hospitalization, deaths, or other
  emergencies. Be sure to log on and comment at least once.
</p>
<h2>Exam / Quiz Policy</h2>
<p>
  All quizzes and Exams are to be taken closed book. All exams and assignments
  are worth approximately ~400 total points. Weekly assignments and/or quizzes
  are due on Sunday at 11:59PM Eastern Standard Time. Something is due every
  week so make sure you are keeping up and doing the assignments for each week.
  Quizzes cannot be accessed after 11:59pm Eastern Standard Time (NO
  EXCEPTIONS). Failing to allow enough time to complete and submit the
  assignment is not a valid excuse and does not qualify as an emergency. Missed
  quizzes will count as a dropped grade. Quizzes cannot be reopened after they
  close for any reason including hospitalization, deaths, or other emergencies.
</p>
<p>
  Exams consist of ~25 multiple choice/ short answer questions and are weighted
  to be worth 50 points each. You are responsible for all material presented
  online and assigned articles and readings. You many not use your notes when
  taking exams or quizzes. You may not perform internet searches when taking
  exams or quizzes. The final is not cumulative; it is simply a fourth test.
  Exams will be taken using Canvas. You may open an exam only one time and must
  submit your answers within a 60 minute period. You will need to schedule an
  appointment with Examity to access the proctored Exams. Exams can be canceled
  and rescheduled however 24 hours’ notice is required. In rare instances I can
  grant extensions for exams given an extreme illness or emergency. Exam
  Extension requests must be made within 7 days of the exam.

<p>
  What is it in your DNA that makes you different from chimpanzees, mice or
  flies? What sequences in your DNA make it more or less likely that you will
  develop diabetes or cancer?
</p>
<p>
  This course will remind students of the basic molecular biology of genes,
  introduce them to major DNA sequencing technologies, and explore how genomic
  technologies are informing principles of genome function globally, with a
  strong emphasis on identifying genes and gene regulatory modules. Students
  will use web-based bioinformatics tools for exploring genomic and epigenetic
  data to complete assignments. Each student also will develop a project on a
  topic in genomics that interests them. The goal of each project will be
  determined mainly by the student’s interest; it can be research or
  educational. The student will choose the medium used to convey the results of
  his/her work. Employing traditional media such as term papers or oral
  presentations is fine, and creative and effective use of popular media (games,
  video, music, dance, etc.) is encouraged.
</p>
<p>
  The course proceeds in two phases, first on the basics of genomics, and second
  on the search for functional elements in genomes.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
  At the end of this course, you will successfully be able to do/perform the
  following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Describe the range of genome sizes and structures of genomes in organisms
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a wide range of sequence alignment tools with a strong appreciation of
    the power and limitations of each for the task at hand
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the community-supported online computational platform Galaxy to analyze
    files with genomic data
  </li>
  <li>
    Use online databases and resources to find information on genes,
    physiologically relevant sets of genes, and entire sets of genes from an
    organism
  </li>
  <li>
    Predict gene structures in long genome sequences
  </li>
  <li>
    Analyze processed results from massively parallel RNA determinations
    (microarray and RNA-seq) to infer functional groups of genes
  </li>
  <li>
    Interpret epigenetic patterns around individual genes and groups of genes to
    infer function
  </li>
  <li>
    Mesh results of genome-wide association studies of complex traits with
    genomic and epigenetic information to improve interpretations

<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>
  Students should complete each of the lessons and a semester project. The
  course will cover 14 lessons spread over the 15 weeks of the course. Each
  lesson covers a topic, and it includes reading material, presentations, and
  homework (no homework for lesson 14). Students should read the assigned texts,
  listen to the presentations, and do the homework. The text material comes from
  online textbooks, reviews and research articles. The presentations are
  provided as VoiceThreads. These are a series of slides on each topic, with a
  recorded presentation from the instructor. You can interact with the
  VoiceThread, and ask questions or make additional points.
</p>
<p>
  A homework assignment is made for 13 of the 14 lessons. Students should turn
  in a report on their work on the assignment. Sometimes you have explicit
  options on the assignment. You also can tailor the assignments to your
  particular interests. If you think of an assignment related to the topic that
  would be more meaningful or more interesting to you, it is very likely that I
  will approve it. Please check in advance of the due dates.
</p>
<p>
  Students will also complete a semester project. The student will chooses a
  topic to present or a problem on which they want to work. It is a good idea to
  discuss your interests with the instructor, so that the scope and content of
  the project can be reasonable and meaningful. Using the material in the course
  as a foundation, the student will define the topic or problem, gather
  material, and analyze data (if appropriate) to describe the topic or solve the
  problem. The student will make a report on the project by the end of the
  semester. As stated above, the medium for presentation of the project will be
  chosen by the student; creativity is welcome. Most reports are papers, but the
  report can be a presentation (e.g. using the VoiceThread technology), a film,
  a song, a comic book, a video game, a board game, a sculpture (all have been
  done in the past), or other medium.

    Become familiar with the practice of analyzing sequencing data from various
    instruments
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop the computationally oriented thinking that is necessary to take on
    large-scale data analysis projects
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Lessons</h2>
<p>
  The Lessons will provide you with general background information and practical
  examples that tie in with the topic. We will share some real life exercises
  and the homework will give you a chance to apply what you have learned for
  each lesson.
</p>
<p>We will cover five topics throughout the course:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Core Informatics Competency
  </li>
  <li>

<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>
  At the end of each lesson, there will be a homework to assess your
  comprehension of the content.
</p>
<p>
  Homework will usually fit on one sheet of paper. You will need to show the
  commands and their output. You additionally can print screens, but please DO
  NOT pring a console output of white text on black background!
</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  Your grade for the course will be the weighted average of all homeworks and a
  final project.
</p>
<p>
  The final project (weight-20%) will be similar, but more complex than a
  typical homework and will require that you use the knowledge of the concepts
  learned throughout the entire course.

<p>
  You are a biological being, as are the foods that you eat. We use products
  from other organisms to make many of the clothes that we wear, build our
  homes, provide medicines, and give beauty to our lives. Therefore, developing
  an appreciation and understanding of the biological world is important to
  living in this world and becoming a responsible steward of its resources. Who
  hasn't watched a bird and wondered what it would be like to be able to fly? To
  see the world from a different perspective? This course will provide an
  introduction to fundamental biological topics (including cells, energy
  transduction, genetics, evolution, organismal structure/function, ecology) for
  non-majors in biology-related fields.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
  By the time you complete this course, you should have learned about the
  following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The role of natural selection, which shapes organisms in response to their
    environment through differential reproduction.
  </li>
  <li>
    The mechanisms of inheritance, and how DNA encodes the genetic information
    for all living organisms.
  </li>
  <li>
    The chemical basis of life, the origin of life on Earth, the structure and
    function of the two basic types of cells, and how cells utilize energy.
  </li>
  <li>
    The fundamentals of plant biology, including plant structure, response, and
    reproduction.
  </li>
  <li>
    The basic organization of the animal body, with a focus on the digestive and

<h2>Discussion Forums</h2>
<p>
  Throughout the 11 lessons in this course, you will be expected to participate
  in discussions on a weekly basis. There are 15 participation points available
  for each lesson, for a total of 165 points. The quality of your participation
  will determine how many points you earn. If you fully answer the questions
  posted, in an original post with no quotes or copy and paste, then you will
  earn 7 pts. If you make 2 substantial replies to your classmates’ posts, then
  you will earn 4 pts each (8 pts total) for a total of 7 + 8 = 15 pts for each
  weekly discussion forum. No late submissions accepted. If you run into any
  difficulties, please email me asap.
</p>
<h2>Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Throughout the 11 lessons in this course, you will be expected to participate
  in multiple choice quizzes on a weekly basis. These short quizzes are to help
  you understand and apply the material being learned that week. You have one
  chance to take each untimed quiz before the weekly deadline. Upon submission
  of your completed quiz, it will be automatically graded, at 10 pts for each
  quiz.
</p>
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>
  Students are expected to take exams at the scheduled times. You will have
  plenty of advance warning as to when the exams are to take place. Please see
  the calendar. Contact me if there is a problem. Only
  legitimate excuses shall warrant a makeup exam to be taken as soon as
  possible. Legitimate excuses can include, but are not limited to, illness,
  family emergencies, trips, get called into work. Sleeping through the alarm is
  NOT a legitimate excuse! Neither is ‘my car broke down’ (bring me your
  mechanic’s bill) or ‘my ISP wasn’t working’----the least you can do is be
  creative! Each open, multiple choice exam is worth 100 pts and automatically
  graded after submission. No proctors required---but Penn State’s Academic
  Integrity policy is in effect. Upon submission of each exam, you are agreeing
  to abide by Penn State’s Academic Integrity policy.

<p>
  An exploration of how cellular structures and processes contribute to life and
  how life displays unity even in its diversity. Students who have passed BIOL
  027, 110, or 141 may not schedule this course.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this course, a successful student will be able to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Understand basic chemical processes that take place in living organisms,
    including organic compounds and the basic macromolecules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Identify cell organelles and describe their functions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand basic energy concepts and how enzymes and membranes function.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand cellular respiration and photosynthesis and how they relate to
    each other.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the cell cycle, mitosis, and meiosis and how they differ.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand basic genetics (inheritance, Mendel’s Laws, DNA structure and
    function, gene regulation, DNA technology).
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand basic population genetics and evolution (natural selection,
    genetic variation, gene pools).
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the classification of organisms, taxonomy, and phylogenetics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand how the biological diversity on Earth originated and survey the
    major groups of organisms (prokaryotes, protists, fungi, plants, animals).
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe some of the issues in medical ethics that have arisen as a result
    of human tissue culture.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>
  You will be expected to check in every day or every other day for any
  announcements or updates. The amount of time spent looking over the material
  typically is correlated with quiz and exam grade: the more time spent studying
  usually translates into a better grade. Although this is an online course, you
  should expect to spend a similar amount of time on the material that you would
  for an in-person class. The general rule for studying is as follows: for every
  one hour of lecture, you should spend 2.5 to 3 hours studying the material.
  That means for a three-credit course, you should spend 7.5 to 9 hours per week
  studying and completing assignments if you intend to do well (“A” or “B”
  level).
</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<h3>Weekly Quizzes</h3>
<p>
  Each week a short quiz (about 15 minutes) will be made available on Canvas,
  covering the material from the previous week’s subject(s). Each quiz will be
  made available starting at 12:01 AM on Monday and will run through 11:59 PM on
  Wednesday. This is designed to ensure that you keep up with your reading and
  study. The quizzes will be in a true/false, matching, or multiple-choice type
  format and are intended to reinforce the main concepts in each chapter. These
  quizzes will only be open for a limited time, so do not go for extended
  periods of time (days, weeks) without having logged into the course. I
  typically do not re-open quizzes unless in the case of technical difficulties
  from my end. If you miss one or a few quizzes, this will not negatively affect
  your grade. If you have taken all 14 quizzes, only your 10 best scores will
  count towards your grade.
</p>
<h3>Book Discussions</h3>
<p>
  Each week, we will have discussions on Canvas about the book The Immortal Life
  of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot. These discussions will consist of one or
  more discussion questions posted by the instructor, which you will respond to
  and discuss. The first response will take place within three days of the
  initial discussion question post and will be at minimum 250 words (longer
  posts are welcome but will not necessarily improve your grade. Quality of post
  and not quantity will determine your score). After everyone has had a chance
  to make an initial response, you will make thoughtful comments on other
  students’ posts on the thread. These comments will be respectful (no name
  calling, threats, trolling, etc.) even if one does not agree with the post in
  question. The normal Penn State guidelines prohibiting harassment and hate
  speech will be in place and will be enforced. We can discuss controversial
  topics like adults because we are adults.
</p>
<h3>Midterm Exam</h3>
<p>
  Approximately every 4 weeks, you will have a midterm exam over the material
  covered. These exams will include true/false, multiple-choice, and/or matching
  questions; in addition there may be diagrams to label and/or short
  free-response questions. Exams will cover material for each “unit”: Exam 1
  will cover material from the beginning of the course until the first exam,
  Exam 2 will cover material after Exam 1 until the second exam, and so forth.
  These will be delivered online, but they will be proctored using Examiny
  software. You will have a window of about 72 hours to take your exam, but you
  must schedule it in advance through the Examiny tab in Canvas. If you make
  changes to your scheduled exam time less than 24 hours before the start of the
  exam window, Examiny will charge you a fee of $3.
</p>
<h3>Final Exam</h3>
<p>
  The final will be similar in format to the midterm exams. The only differences
  will be that the final will be slightly (about 50%) longer, and will be
  cumulative . The cumulative section will be about 33% of the final, and the
  remainder will be material covered after the third midterm. The final should
  be scheduled during Finals Week.

      <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This course combines Genetics, Human Genetics, Evolution and Ecology. It is an
  introductory course for non-science majors, and it is hoped that you will
  develop a basic understanding of genetic and biological terms and their
  importance to our technologically advanced society. Evolution is a central
  theme of biology and it helps us to understand the process of life that is
  ongoing all across our globe. The interactions among members of that global
  community provide the backdrop for understanding the ecology of our planet and
  our place in that community. There are no prerequisites for this course.
</p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>
  All students are expected to complete the weekly quizzes on time. These will
  be available for at least one week so budget your time accordingly. You are
  not able to take all of your tests at one time and be done. This course is
  paced so you can progress through at a reasonable speed.
</p>
<p>
  Each week there will be at least one lesson for you to study. Each lesson will
  have one quiz, one homework assignment, and textbook assignment (LearnSmart
  modules, Labs, etc.). Be aware that some weeks there may be more than one
  lesson, thus more than one quiz and homework/textbook assignments. Each of
  these have specific due dates listed on the folder in which you find them.
</p>
<p>
  You may complete the homework and textbook assignments early as they will be
  available from the start of the semester. However, each quiz has a definite
  shelf life. Quizzes are meant to activate on a Saturday and deactivate on the
  following Sunday. That means you have more than a week to complete it. At no
  other time will you be able to view or complete quizzes, it is impossible to
  open up the quiz for a single person. The only exception to this is an
  instance of the quiz being improperly configured. If I short the class on time
  due an incorrect setting I will open up the quiz for additional time and
  everyone will have an opportunity to then complete it. However, that has been
  a rare event (but if it happens, notify the instructor). Pay attention to due
  dates, each assignment has one listed with the folder for that week.
</p>
<p>
  The quizzes are set to overlap so you can manage your schedule if you happen
  to be away from a computer for an entire weekend. If you know that will happen
  then either get things out of the way very early or make it a point to finish
  the following weekend. Missing an assignment should never happen if you manage
  your time properly. You will be entirely responsible for your time and
  scheduling.
</p>
<p>
  The weekly quizzes will be timed so it will not be possible to look up the
  answers to these questions at your leisure. The expectation is that you will
  study the content, gain some level of mastery of the terminology and take the
  tests to see how well you know everything. You are not to have access to
  sources of information when you take these tests, they are not open book.
</p>
<p>
  The homework assignments may be completed ahead of schedule but not after the
  due date. Being late a day or two will result in a late penalty. Homework
  turned in after that will result in a zero. Homework assignments should not be
  copied from any other source, cited correctly or not. Many assignments will
  have you finding information from sources including the internet, however, a
  cut and paste job does not equal effort. Googling information is not
  considered an academic achievement.
</p>
<p>
  Everything you write is expected to be your own work, not something you find
  and copy from the internet. It's perfectly clear when students have
  plagiarized a paragraph from a web page. It only takes 30 minutes to find a
  few web sites about a topic and then write up a summary of what you find.
  Don't risk University sanctions and an F for a homework assignment that should
  take less than an hour. See the statement on academic integrity for further
  information.
</p>
<h2>Late Assignments / Technical Difficulites</h2>
<p>
  Since you have seven days in which to submit homework, and take a quiz, I will
  not accept illness or technical difficulties as an excuse to make up missed
  work. The only exception to this would be an extended hospitalization stay.
  All quizzes and homework message boards are available at the beginning of of
  the course. The due dates listed with each assignment are the last days that a
  quiz or homework assignment is available. To avoid missing deadlines, submit
  your work early and avoid waiting until the last evening at 11:55 pm to submit
  your homework or take a quiz. Your internet dropping out at the last possible
  minute to submit work is not a reasonable cause for being unable to complete
  work in a timely manner. Do not turn in work at the last possible minute. No
  scores will be dropped. Work cannot be turned in for a higher grade once a
  grade is assigned. There will be no opportunities to turn in extra work for
  extra credit. Be prepared to do the necessary work to reach your goals for a
  final grade.
</p>
<h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
<p>
  All course work will be submitted to your instructor through Canvas. To do
  this, you will need to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Click on the Modules button in the menu bar at the left of this page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose the folder for the week we are currently in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click on the homework assignment for the week.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type your answer into the text box
  </li>
  <li>
    Click "submit assignment"
  </li>
  <li>
    At the appropriate time click on the quiz for that week and complete it
    within the time specified or it will automatically submit whether you are
    finished or not.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  The Grading Scale can be found in the Getting Started section of Canvas. All
  grades can be found in Canvas by going to the Grades button on the left hand
  side.
</p>
<p>
  Each lesson has a quiz that will vary in length between 10 and 20 points each.
  Some will be longer than others depending on the amount of material covered in
  a particular lesson.
</p>
<p>
  Each quiz question is worth 1 point out of the total. Every question is worth
  exactly the same as any other question; only the length of the quiz each week
  will vary. Do not think in terms of percentage points here, this will be a
  point system based on total points.
</p>
<p>
  Students will work on these assignments as an individual and will be
  responsible for completing them on time. Late assignments will have a
  deduction, assignments more than a couple of days late will not be accepted.
  Once we reach the end of the course it will not be possible to go back and
  complete work that is outdated by weeks or even months. Keep up on assignments
  to gain maximum points.
</p>
<p>
  Grades are based on a combination of quizzes where each question is worth one
  point and various homework assignments worth a handful of points. All students
  are expected to complete the weekly quizzes on time. These will be available
  for at least one week so budget your time accordingly. You are not able to
  take all your tests at one time and be done. This course is paced so you can
  progress through at a reasonable speed.Each homework assignment has a specific
  number of points associated with it.
</p>
<p>
  Any questions concerning a particular quiz or homework assignment must be
  resolved immediately. You cannot wait till the end of the semester to correct
  any problems. Due to time constraints, it will be impossible to review all
  assignments on the last day in the hope of finding one or two points to meet a
  grade cutoff. You should ask that all grading issues be resolved as they occur
  during the semester. No exams will be dropped; no extra credit will be
  accepted. It's impossible to evaluate hundreds of book reports or shoebox
  dioramas.
</p>
<h2>Deferred Grades</h2>
<p>
  Students who are unable to complete the course because of illness or emergency
  may be granted a deferred grade which will allow the student to complete the
  course within the first six weeks of the following semester.
</p>
<p>
  When a request for a deferred grade is supported by the instructor, the
  instructor indicates this approval by recording the deferred grade symbol (DF)
  for the student. The expiration date for the deferred grade is automatically
  recorded as the end of the sixth week of the next semester. Spring semester
  approvals expire during the fall semester unless the student enrolls during
  summer session. Therefore, course requirements must be completed and a grade
  must be submitted by the end of six weeks into the student’s next semester for
  which he or she is registered. Any deferred grade that is not replaced by the
  deadline will automatically become an F.
</p>
<p>
  Note that deferred grades are limited to those students who can verify and
  document a valid reason for not being able to complete the last few
  assignments, not for gaining extra time to complete missing work from earlier
  in the semester. Students are expected to have completed at least 75% of the
  course assignments to be eligible for a deferment. For more information see DF
  grade.

<h2>Lesson Assignments (20%)</h2>
<p>
  Each lesson will conclude with a few homework assignments. The format of each
  assignment will vary and may include fill-in-the blank, short essay, and
  multiple choice questions. Each assignment will be due at the end of each
  lesson before beginning the next lesson. The lowest assignment grade will be
  dropped, and all of the others will be weighted equally.
</p>
<h2>Video Demonstration Summaries (5%)</h2>
<p>
  There will be multiple video demonstrations for some of the lessons. A short
  online submission (one page or less in length) will be required for five of
  the demonstrations. Each submission will go into a separate dropbox and must
  include a description of the demonstration, the concept being presented, your
  observations, and any suggestions you may have to change or expand the
  demonstration. Watch all the videos, but please only submit summaries for 5 of
  the videos.
</p>
<h2>Lab Experiment Reports (25%)</h2>
<p>
  There will be four lab experiments performed individually by the student. Each
  experiment will have an online report submitted consisting of experimental
  data, observations and short answers to interpretive questions.
</p>
<h2>Non-Proctored Online Mid-Term Exams (30%)</h2>
<p>
  The two exams will have multiple choice questions. Both will have a 90-minute
  time limit. Only one attempt is allowed. Each exam will be worth 15% of the
  final grade.
</p>
<h2>Non-Proctored, Closed-Book, Comprehensive Final Exam (20%)</h2>
<p>
  Students will complete a closed-book final exam consisting of multiple-choice
  questions that will be similar in scope to those given in the homework
  assignments and mid-term exams. Students will need to print out the Useful
  Information file located in the Exams folder, which may be used when
  completing the final exam. The file includes a periodic table, a list of key
  equations, and a solubility table.
</p>
<p>
  You will also need a scientific calculator to take the Final Exam. If you want
  to know whether your calculator is allowed, email your instructor as soon as
  possible.

      <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The possible existence of life beyond Earth is one of the most fundamental
  questions relating the human race to the physical Universe around us. While
  considerations of extraterrestrial life were in the domains of philosophy and
  science fiction in the past, today we have considerable scientific knowledge
  that can be applied to the question. Advances in modern astronomy have
  dramatically improved our understanding of our cosmic surroundings: tracing
  the cosmic origins of biological molecules, direct evidence for planets around
  most stars (exoplanets), and a deeper understanding of planet formation have
  all emerged in the past generation. Several fields -- geology, biochemistry,
  paleontology (fossils), evolutionary biology -- give insight (though not a
  complete understanding) on how life arose on Earth, and spacecraft travel
  provides constraints on life elsewhere in our Solar System.
</p>
<p>
  The results from studies on Earth, the Solar System, and exoplanets across the
  Galaxy together indicate that the conditions for life are widespread in the
  Universe; extraterrestrial life has not been found yet, but does not seem
  implausible. Interstellar space travel between habitable planets, by humans or
  other beings, is exceedingly difficult but not physically impossible. The
  course is thus rooted in modern science, but is connected to the long-standing
  philosophical question: Are we alone in the Universe? Today, this question is
  often embedded in science fiction (such as movies about aliens) and discussion
  about whether aliens have visited Earth. Today, astronomical studies are
  leading the way in answering part of the question: Earth-like planets seems to
  be extremely common. But there is no evidence yet for life outside of Earth.
</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>
  Part of the course resembles a traditional classroom learning environment: We
  have lectures by the instructor (online rather than in person), read chapters
  of our textbook, and take quizzes to evaluate that we have learned the
  material. But the course also has more (inter)active assignments: students
  participate in discussion forums; take part in a huge citizen science research
  effort; and engage in science writing, producing two papers. The result is a
  multifaceted learning experience, blending more passive knowledge acquisition
  with more active learning processes.
</p>
<h2>Outline</h2>
<p>
  The course is divided into five broad themes that are, in turn, divided into
  several topics. The course is designed as a 15-week course with a new Web page
  environment for each week. Readings from our textbook, {selected textbook for

</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<h3>Quizzes (48%)</h3>
<p>
  Four times during the semester after a Theme is completed, students will take
  a quiz on recent material covered in the class, associated reading and online
  material. The quizzes will last 40 minutes and have combinations of multiple
  choice, short answer and short essay questions. Students may have access to
  notes and the textbook, but study prior to the quiz is necessary because of
  the time constraint. Quizzes are taken in Penn State's ANGEL Web environment.
  Students can take the quiz anytime during specified 4-day periods from
  early-Friday to end-of-day Monday. Quizzes are `open book, open Web' format
  without proctoring; however, they are timed so that students are who are not
  familiar with the material cannot perform well. Each Quiz is worth 12% of the
  course grade.
</p>
<h3>Science Writing Papers (27%)</h3>
<p>
  Students will submit two original papers using topics and resources provided
  by (or in agreement with) the instructor. The goal is to learn techniques of
  science writing: the papers review scientific findings and will present them
  in a formal style. General guidence is given here, and the student and
  instructor interact individually on Paper #1. The student then writes Paper #2
  on their own; it is the same length as Paper #1 but is worth more points as
  the student can incorporate what they have leared about science writing. There
  are three deadlines: a draft of Paper 1, the final version of Paper 1 and, at
  the beginning of Exam Week, delivery of Paper 2. Details on science writing,
  paper requirements, and sample topics are given here. Paper #1 is worth 12% of
  the course grade, and Paper #2 is worth 15% of the course grade.
</p>
<h3>Discussion Forums (15%)</h3>
<p>
  Throughout the course, we will hold informal discussions on through PSU's
  ANGEL, and optionally VoiceThread, environment. The instructor will start with
  a question, sometimes accompanied with on-line material. Students then
  participate with independent or secondary commentaries. Points are earned by
  number and quality of contributions; contributions based on factual material
  is preferred over informal opinions. The maximum contribution is 15% of the
  course grade.
</p>
<h3>PlanetHunters Activity (10%)</h3>
<p>
  During Weeks 8-9, students will engage in the Zooniverse `citizen science'
  activity PlanetHunters. This involves a training session, classification of
  ~30 lightcurves from NASA's Kepler mission for possible planet transits, and
  completion of a worksheet and analysis. The goal is to examine observations
  from the Kepler observations of ~200,000 stars, characterizing the variability
  of the star and looking for periodic dips in brightness due to transiting
  planets.
</p>
<p>
  At the end of the semester, course grades (A/A-/B+/B/B-/C+/C/D/F) will be
  calculated on a `curve' based on the instructor's judgment of class
  performance. Throughout the semester, each student can access their grades for
  past work on the ANGEL gradebook.
