  Recently, the Office of Digital Learning (Eberly College of Science at Penn
  State) participated in the ninth consecutive <a href="https://www.drupalcampnj.org/">Drupal Camp NJ</a>
, hosted at
  Princeton University. The weekend witnessed developers and industry
  professionals collaborating on a number of Drupal initiatives through
  informative presentations, networking opportunities, and engaging training
  sessions.
</p>
<p>
  Demonstrating their progress since Drupal Camp NJ 2019, the ODL team continued
  where they left off with their discussion on decoupling Drupal. Specifically,
  Michal Potter and I joined <a href="https://www.elmsln.org/">ELMS:LN</a>
 lead developer, Bryan Ollendyke (College of
  Arts and Architecture - Penn State) and Rebecca Goodman (Branch Chief, Web at
  U.S. <a href="https://www.archives.gov/">National Archives and Records Administration</a>
 / NARA) to present work on
  web components.
</p>
<p>
  Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create custom,
  reusable, HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Because they’re built
  using web standards, they will work across all modern browsers and within any
  JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML. The team has been
  actively working to implement web components across a number of projects,
  including a custom suite of authoring tools (<a href="https://haxtheweb.org/">HAX</a>
), Drupal, WordPress, Grav CMS
  and more.
</p>
<p>
  Bryan Ollendyke jump-started the conversation with a great introduction and
  Michael Potter and I showcased our implementation of web components across
  several custom web themes. The highlight of the talk was Rebecca Goodman
  announcing that her web team at NARA had started implementing web components
  into their work-flow by successfully placing a branding bar across several of
  their existing web properties.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, feedback was extremely positive. The audience contained a wide
  variety of technical backgrounds. Developers quickly understood how they could
  reduce technical debt across their projects, graphic designers saw how their
  interactions with Content Management Systems could be simplified, and project
  managers realized how this approach could reduce timelines of maintenance and
  enhancement across the board.
</p>
<p>
  Check out our presentation below and see how web components can revolutionize
  your next web project:

  This past weekend (February 1-3) the Office of Digital Learning (Eberly
  College of Science at Penn State) participated in the eighth consecutive
  <a href="https://www.drupalcampnj.org/" target="_blank">Drupal Camp NJ</a>



, hosted at Princeton University. The annual event brings
  developers and industry professionals from varying backgrounds and
  skill-levels together to share all things <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>


 through engaging
  presentations, co-working sessions, and networking.
</p>
<p>
  This year there were a number of great discussions to get involved with, but
  one topic continued to dominate the conversation - decoupling Drupal.
  Decoupling Drupal essentially means separating Drupal’s front-end (theme
  layer) from it’s back-end (data/content layer) using a custom JavaScript
  framework. While there are still some discussions as to which framework is
  ‘best’ when decoupling Drupal, the general consensus is that the decoupled
  method is becoming an industry-wide movement.
</p>
<p>
  Jesus Manuel Olivas (Head of Products at <a href="https://weknowinc.com/" target="_blank">weKnow</a>

) showcased decoupling tools
  like <a href="http://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>
 and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/tome" target="_blank">Tome</a>
. These tools assist in creating static sites by
  decoupling Drupal’s theme and just using Drupal for content creation.
</p>
<p>
  Saurabh Chugh and Surendra Singh hosted a discussion, ‘Decoupling Patterns,
  Services and creating an enterprise level editorial experience’ where they
  also emphasized using decoupled applications to display content.

<p>
  Our team demonstrated decoupled development when Michal Potter and Charles
  Lavera joined ELMS:LN lead developer, Bryan Ollendyke (College of Arts and
  Architecture - Penn State) to present work on web components. Specifically,
  the trio discussed the tooling they use to quickly generate and publish their
  components onto the web (<a href="https://github.com/elmsln/wcfactory" target="_blank">WCFactory</a>
 / Drupal <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/webcomponents" target="_blank">webcomponents module</a>
). In
  addition, Bryan explored the future of content-authoring with a completely
  headless authoring experience called HAX.

    allows you to create a
    project outline complete with instructions and assessment possibilities. In
    this video, I set up a simple
    demonstration that identifies some basic goals while also asking users to
    supply their insight as they traverse
    through each step. Specifically, we look over the general settings of the
    tool and work through building an
    example that will help users scaffold out a detailed steps-to-completion
    outline, create a plan of attack, and
    organize / assess individual goals and contributions. At the end, we'll
    review the different ways we can
    implement this newly created content into your website. Check it out!

  Michael is an educational technologist who brings a decade’s worth of
  experience building websites and applications to the edtech space. His
  non-traditional path began at Penn State where he earned his BA in Political
  Science. From there, Michael joined a local venture capital group where he was
  involved with many different companies and handled everything from sales, to
  product development, to logistics and shipping. When one such company lost
  their only web developer, Michael was tapped to takeover the programming
  responsibilities and the rest is history. Michael was immediately hooked with
  web development and begin soaking up every piece of information the web could
  offer.
<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
  Since then, Michael has gained a wealth of experience in the full stack of web
  applications. His skillset is most notable in the area of front-end
  development and the Drupal framework. He has a passion for writing code,
  learning how to code, and mentoring fellow programmers. Michael has a unique
  gift for connecting, inspiring, and empowering others.
  <br/>
  <br/>

<div>
  Innovative, forward thinking, risk taking are some of the reasons Michael
  wanted to work at ODL. His goal is to create technology and applications that
  remove barriers between educators and students. Michael believes that the web
  can enable people to change their lives for the better.

  I have always been obsessed with visuals. When I was a kid I would go through

  didn’t need the article on the back, then clip it out and safely tuck it away
  in a flat, waxed-cardboard box under my bed - only to find out years later

  These days, I apply my passion for visual arts to graphic design and

      <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Cellular structure and organization; physiological processes; classification;
  reproduction and development; relationship of plant groups. Students who have
  passed BIOL 240W may not schedule this course
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>During the course of the semester, the student will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Develop critical thinking skills, gather credible information, question
    ideas from a scientific viewpoint
  </li>
  <li>Learn and integrate terms and concepts in plant biology</li>
  <li>
    Understand how plant structure (cellular, organismal) and function
    (biochemical) are tied together
  </li>
  <li>
    Learn how plants and humans interact and the outcomes of this interaction
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop laboratory skills to investigate plant evolution, anatomy, and
    physiology
  </li>
  <li>
    Design an experimental approach that addresses a concept in plant biology
  </li>
  <li>
    Summarize, in the style of a scientific journal article, the design,
    rationale, results, interpretation, and conclusions of a scientific
    experiment or studyP
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Required Materials</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Bidlack J., Jansky S., and Stern K. Stern’s Introductory Plant Biology, 13th
    ed. ISBN-13: 978- 0073369440, ISBN-10: 0073369446
  </li>
  <li>
    Carolina Biological Botany Lab Kits Purchase at:
    https://www.carolina.com/carolina-distancelearning-science-kits/the-pennsylvania-state-university-introductory-plant-biology-biol-127/581864.pr
  </li>
  <li>
    Digital camera with ability to upload pictures to Canvas
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Attendance / Participation</h2>
<p>
  You will be expected to check in every day or every other day for any
  announcements or updates. The amount of time spent looking over the material
  typically is correlated with quiz and exam grade: the more time spent studying
  usually translates into a better grade. Although this is an online course, you
  should expect to spend a similar amount of time on the material that you would
  for an inperson class. The general rule for studying is as follows: for every
  one hour of lecture, you should spend 2.5 to 3 hours studying the material.
  That means for a three-credit course, you should spend 7.5 to 9 hours per week
  studying and completing assignments if you intend to do well (“A” or “B”
  level).
</p>
<h2>Labs</h2>
<p>
  You will complete 11 labs related to the material covered during that week.
  The lab materials must be ordered through Carolina Biological Supplies, and
  will be delivered to your home. The labs are designed for you to complete at
  your home, with the exception of one lab, where you will be required to go to
  a local park, arboretum, or botanical garden. Though in some cases the lab
  will reinforce concepts covered in the book and in the PowerPoints, the lab
  may also cover a unique topic. For this reason, material covered in lab
  activities will be included on exams. If you have completed all 11 labs, only
  your 10 best scores will count towards your grade.
</p>
<h2>Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Each week one or more short quizzes covering that week’s chapter contents must
  be completed. The quizzes are designed to ensure that you keep up with your
  reading and study. The quizzes will be in a true/false, matching, or
  multiple-choice type format and are intended to reinforce the main concepts in
  each chapter. Utilize the weekly objectives as a study guide for the quizzes
  and exams. These quizzes will only be open for a limited time, so do not go
  for extended periods of time (days, weeks) without having logged into the
  course. I typically do not re-open quizzes unless in the case of technical
  difficulties from my end. If you miss one or a few quizzes, this will not
  negatively affect your grade. If you have taken all 23 quizzes, only your 20
  best scores will count towards your grade.
</p>
<h2>Video Discussions</h2>
<p>
  During the semester, you will watch two documentaries: The Botany of Desire,
  broken into four parts of 30 minutes each, and America’s Lost Landscape: The
  Tallgrass Prairie which is 60 minutes. This is a total of five discussion
  forums. For each forum, you will be asked to post a response or answers
  questions. Your first post is due 24 hours prior to the due date for the
  assignment. If the post is late, no points will be awarded (see discussion
  instructions in the week 1 module on Canvas for more detailed instructions).
  The discussions are worth 25 points each.
</p>
<h2>Lab Report</h2>
<p>
  One lab will require that you write a formal lab report. This is meant to give
  you practice at scientific writing. You will complete a peer-review draft, a
  rough draft, and a final draft (see the instruction in the Effects of Ethylene
  on Fruit Ripening Lab and the individual Lab Report assignments on Canvas for
  more details).
</p>
<h2>Exams</h2>
<p>
  During the semester, you will have three exams and a final exam over the
  material covered. These exams will include true/false, multiple-choice, and/or
  matching questions; in addition there may be diagrams to label and/or short
  free-response questions. Exams will cover material for each “unit”: Exam 1
  will cover material from the beginning of the course until the first exam,
  Exam 2 will cover material after Exam 1 until the second exam, and so forth.
  The final will be similar in format to the midterm exams. The only differences
  will be that the final will be slightly (about 50%) longer, and will be
  cumulative. The cumulative section will be about 33% of the final, and the
  remainder will be material covered after the third midterm. All exams will be
  delivered online, but they will be proctored, using Examity (see Examity
  section under University Policies). You will have a window of about 72 hours
  to take your exam, but you must schedule it in advance through the Examity tab
  in Canvas. If you make changes to your scheduled exam time less than 24 hours
  before the start of the exam window, Examity will charge you a fee of $3.

      <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The human body is fascinating to most of us, presumably because we have a
  rather vested interest in it. It is especially interesting when we include the
  physiology of diseases, as diseases often represent good illustrations of the
  systems not functioning properly. I have tried to include information that
  will both sustain and stimulate your interest, as well as challenge you to
  extend your knowledge outside this course. There are many good programs on the
  Public Broadcasting System and cable TV as well as articles in magazines such
  as Science News, Scientific American, Discover, Scientific American Science
  and Medicine, and Natural History that illustrate the fascinating aspects of
  human physiology. One of the goals of this course is to develop your ability
  to understand the more complex scientific and medical advances that are
  occurring with increasing frequency today.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
  This course is designed to cover the fundamentals of human physiology for
  students in a variety of life science-related majors including Nursing,
  Kinesiology, Athletic Training, and Science. By the time you complete this
  course, you should:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a working knowledge and understanding of basic human physiology.</li>
  <li>
    Be able to apply these physiological principles to problem solving
    situations as observed in medical situations, including cardiac problems,
    hypertension, renal failure, acid-base balance disturbances, and endocrine
    imbalances.
  </li>
  <li>
    Have a practical understanding of physiology upon which you can build and
    use in future clinical settings.
  </li>

  Biology 155 is a 3-credit lecture course designed to give both science and
  non-science majors a basic understanding of the aging process, with special
  emphasis on aging as it relates to the human body and health. The first third
  of the course will discuss important aging terminology, methods of measuring
  aging, current theories of the aging process, and research models used to
  study aging. The later two thirds of the course will review aging as related
  to specific body systems. As such, portions of lessons will review normal
  anatomy (structure naming) and physiology (body function) of these body
  systems. In this later section, details of both senescence and age-related
  disease processes will be discussed.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Upon completion of this course, you will have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Developed a functional understanding of how our bodies change over time
  </li>
  <li>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  Your course grade will be based upon your performance on the lesson
  assignments and two examinations. The lesson assignments will be 1/3 of the
  final course grade, with the mid-course counting as 1/3 and the final counting
  as the last 1/3. Examinations will have 30 multiple choice, matching and
  true/false questions, worth 80% of the exam points, and the remaining 20% of
  the exam points will be performance on a short essay and term definitions. The
  mid-course exam will stress material developed in lesson assignments 2-7. The
  final exam will stress material developed in lesson assignments 9-14, and will
  not be comprehensive. That said, some broad concepts developed throughout the
  course, could be found in some questions.

<p>
  This course presents a thorough background on the basic structure and function
  of the human reproductive system. Goals are to provide the student with
  sufficient knowledge to understand and discuss sex-related topics and make
  informed personal decisions. Through online presentations and class discussion
  students will be exposed to information that will clarify their understanding
  of the ways that their own body functions in sexual behavior and reproduction.
  Importantly, students will examine the roles of reproductive physiology and
  sexuality in a historical, cultural and social context, with particular
  emphasis on cultural and gender differences in anatomical forms, sexual
  expression, and disease. The course will present current research on human sex
  and reproduction, and explore the biology behind human sexuality and medicine.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
  By the end of this course, students should have gained sufficient knowledge
  to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Trace the pathway sperm must take through the male and female reproductive
    system to complete successful fertilization
  </li>
  <li>
    Diagram gametogenesis, including both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions;
    describe when these processes occur (fetal development/puberty/maturity)
  </li>
  <li>
    Diagram the uterine and ovarian cycles; explain how hypothalamic, pituitary,
    and ovarian hormones coordinate both cycles to create the menstrual cycle
  </li>
  <li>

<h2>Quizzes</h2>
<p>
  Quizzes consist of 5-10 multiple choice, ordering, multiple select and
  true/false questions based on the weekly lectures and web assignments. These
  will be available in Canvas in the weekly modules folders. You can submit the
  quiz anytime during the week, but you will be given 15-20 minutes to complete
  the quiz and only one attempt. Do not open the quiz until you have viewed all
  the course material for that week. You will be presented with 14 quizzes, but
  only your top 12 quiz scores will be considered in the final grade
  calculation. If you fail to take a quiz in the allotted time for any reason it
  will be counted as one of your dropped scores.
</p>
<h2>Discussion Boards</h2>
<p>
  Discussion boards require full class participation. Each discussion board is a
  maximum of 5 points total. Discussion topics are testable on exams and you may
  see exam questions on that material. It is in your best interest to check back
  and read comments throughout the week. Posting to the discussion board after
  the due date when classmates are no longer engaging is pointless (there is no
  one else logging on to discuss) and therefore worth 0 points. I do not accept
  late discussion posts under any circumstances. Discussions cannot be reopened
  after they close for any reason including hospitalization, deaths, or other
  emergencies. Be sure to log on and comment at least once.
</p>
<h2>Exam / Quiz Policy</h2>
<p>
  All quizzes and Exams are to be taken closed book. All exams and assignments
  are worth approximately ~400 total points. Weekly assignments and/or quizzes
  are due on Sunday at 11:59PM Eastern Standard Time. Something is due every
  week so make sure you are keeping up and doing the assignments for each week.
  Quizzes cannot be accessed after 11:59pm Eastern Standard Time (NO
  EXCEPTIONS). Failing to allow enough time to complete and submit the
  assignment is not a valid excuse and does not qualify as an emergency. Missed
  quizzes will count as a dropped grade. Quizzes cannot be reopened after they
  close for any reason including hospitalization, deaths, or other emergencies.
</p>
<p>
  Exams consist of ~25 multiple choice/ short answer questions and are weighted
  to be worth 50 points each. You are responsible for all material presented
  online and assigned articles and readings. You many not use your notes when
  taking exams or quizzes. You may not perform internet searches when taking
  exams or quizzes. The final is not cumulative; it is simply a fourth test.
  Exams will be taken using Canvas. You may open an exam only one time and must
  submit your answers within a 60 minute period. You will need to schedule an
  appointment with Examity to access the proctored Exams. Exams can be canceled
  and rescheduled however 24 hours’ notice is required. In rare instances I can
  grant extensions for exams given an extreme illness or emergency. Exam
  Extension requests must be made within 7 days of the exam.

<p>
  What is it in your DNA that makes you different from chimpanzees, mice or
  flies? What sequences in your DNA make it more or less likely that you will
  develop diabetes or cancer?
</p>
<p>
  This course will remind students of the basic molecular biology of genes,
  introduce them to major DNA sequencing technologies, and explore how genomic
  technologies are informing principles of genome function globally, with a
  strong emphasis on identifying genes and gene regulatory modules. Students
  will use web-based bioinformatics tools for exploring genomic and epigenetic
  data to complete assignments. Each student also will develop a project on a
  topic in genomics that interests them. The goal of each project will be
  determined mainly by the student’s interest; it can be research or
  educational. The student will choose the medium used to convey the results of
  his/her work. Employing traditional media such as term papers or oral
  presentations is fine, and creative and effective use of popular media (games,
  video, music, dance, etc.) is encouraged.
</p>
<p>
  The course proceeds in two phases, first on the basics of genomics, and second
  on the search for functional elements in genomes.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>
  At the end of this course, you will successfully be able to do/perform the
  following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Describe the range of genome sizes and structures of genomes in organisms
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a wide range of sequence alignment tools with a strong appreciation of
    the power and limitations of each for the task at hand
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the community-supported online computational platform Galaxy to analyze
    files with genomic data
  </li>
  <li>
    Use online databases and resources to find information on genes,
    physiologically relevant sets of genes, and entire sets of genes from an
    organism
  </li>
  <li>
    Predict gene structures in long genome sequences
  </li>
  <li>
    Analyze processed results from massively parallel RNA determinations
    (microarray and RNA-seq) to infer functional groups of genes
  </li>
  <li>
    Interpret epigenetic patterns around individual genes and groups of genes to
    infer function
  </li>
  <li>
    Mesh results of genome-wide association studies of complex traits with
    genomic and epigenetic information to improve interpretations

<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>
  Students should complete each of the lessons and a semester project. The
  course will cover 14 lessons spread over the 15 weeks of the course. Each
  lesson covers a topic, and it includes reading material, presentations, and
  homework (no homework for lesson 14). Students should read the assigned texts,
  listen to the presentations, and do the homework. The text material comes from
  online textbooks, reviews and research articles. The presentations are
  provided as VoiceThreads. These are a series of slides on each topic, with a
  recorded presentation from the instructor. You can interact with the
  VoiceThread, and ask questions or make additional points.
</p>
<p>
  A homework assignment is made for 13 of the 14 lessons. Students should turn
  in a report on their work on the assignment. Sometimes you have explicit
  options on the assignment. You also can tailor the assignments to your
  particular interests. If you think of an assignment related to the topic that
  would be more meaningful or more interesting to you, it is very likely that I
  will approve it. Please check in advance of the due dates.
</p>
<p>
  Students will also complete a semester project. The student will chooses a
  topic to present or a problem on which they want to work. It is a good idea to
  discuss your interests with the instructor, so that the scope and content of
  the project can be reasonable and meaningful. Using the material in the course
  as a foundation, the student will define the topic or problem, gather
  material, and analyze data (if appropriate) to describe the topic or solve the
  problem. The student will make a report on the project by the end of the
  semester. As stated above, the medium for presentation of the project will be
  chosen by the student; creativity is welcome. Most reports are papers, but the
  report can be a presentation (e.g. using the VoiceThread technology), a film,
  a song, a comic book, a video game, a board game, a sculpture (all have been
  done in the past), or other medium.

<h2>Late Submission Policy</h2>
<p>
  Meeting assigned due dates is critical for demonstrating progress and ensuring
  appropriate time for instructor feedback on assignments. We recommend that you
  try to complete the assignments as close to the scheduled time as possible.
</p>
<p>
  However, sometimes students are unable to meet due dates. In those rare cases,
  the following late submission policy applies:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    There is a 3-day grace period on all due dates, except midterm exams,
    assignments for Lesson 12, and the final project. For example, the lab 1
    report is due at 11:59 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) Sunday September 2,
    however you'll still receive full credit if you submit the report by 11:59
    pm EST Wednesday September 5.
  </li>
  <li>
    With the exception of the midterm exams, assignments for Lesson 12, and the
    final project, you may submit assignments late up until the last day of the
    semester. Note that each Canvas assignment will automatically stop accepting
    submission after the 3-day grace period, so instructor approval is needed
    for late submissions. A penalty of ten percent (10%) per week will be
    applied to the grade you achieved on the assignment for each week the
    assignment is submitted after the deadline.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assignments will not be accepted after the last day of the semester unless a
    Deferred Grade has been approved by the instructor.
  </li>
  <li>
    I will grade late submitted assignments no later than a week after you
    submit the assignment. Be sure to notify me of the late submission and to
    ensure that I have received the assignment. The full ten percent (10%) late
    penalty for each week applies regardless of the day of the week you submit
    your work.
  </li>
  <li>
    I may accept late work for full credit in the case of extenuating
    circumstances (such as hospitalization, childbirth, major accident or injury
    and bereavement). You should notify me immediately of any extenuating
    circumstances that prevent you from submitting your work on time.
  </li>

      <![CDATA[ <h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The purpose of this course is to provide you with an introduction to atomic
  and molecular structure as well as molecular properties. We will also discuss
  general principles of reactions including stoichiometry and some
  thermodynamics. The long-term goal of this course is to get you to begin
  thinking of chemistry in your everyday life. You should begin noticing that
  chemistry is everywhere: it is in the foods we eat, the ingredients in our
  soaps, and the reason flowers and leaves have specific colors. I encourage you
  to send me anything that you find interesting about chemistry including
  videos, pictures, or websites.
</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of the course, students will be able to…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define key terms and concepts in chemistry</li>
  <li>
    Explain how atomic and molecular structure relates to macroscopic
    (observable) properties of matter
  </li>
  <li>
    Define the various forms of energy, explain how energy interacts with
    matter, and be able to calculate the energy changes associated with chemical
    and physical processes
  </li>
  <li>
    Apply chemistry concepts to solve mathematical problems on homework, problem
    sets, and exams
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe the chemistry behind phenomena in everyday life (i.e. why water is
    a liquid)

<h2>Skills Check (~2%)</h2>
<p>
  The skills check is an opportunity to review topics from high school chemistry
  that will be used in CHEM 110. There are two parts to each of the five topics,
  aptly named “Part A” and “Part B.” Each part is a quiz with 5-7 questions and
  a 20-minute time limit. In Part A, you may take the quiz as many times as you
  like. Once you are confident in the skill, you can take Part B up to three
  times. Only the highest score in each part will be recorded. (Everyone can
  earn 100%!!!!) Your average percent score on all 10 quizzes (5 skills, two
  parts each) will be your grade on the skills check. For example, if you earn
  an 80%, you would earn 12 of 15 points.
</p>
<h2>Midterm Exams (~13%)</h2>
<p>
  There will be four (4) 50-minute midterm exams given over the course of the
  semester. Exams will focus on material covered since the last exam; however,
  you are still responsible for information presented previously. If you read
  your lecture notes & the eBook and solve the recommended problems, you will be
  able to anticipate the exam questions; all concepts could make multiple
  appearances. The exams will consist of short answer questions and open-ended
  problems. Some questions may be multiple choice. Stay tuned to announcements
  on the format.
</p>
<h2>Final Exam (~26%)</h2>
<p>
  A cumulative final exam will be given during the week of December 11. The exam
  window will be announced later in the semester. The final exam will be
  proctored remotely just as the midterm exams.
</p>
<h2>Homework Sets (~8%)</h2>
<p>
  There will be 15 graded homework sets (4 points each) throughout the semester.
  One assignment will be due every week. On most occasions homework will be
  graded solely based on completion and effort. On several randomly selected
  occasions, however, one randomly selected problem from the homework assignment
  will be graded for 2 points based on correctness. On those occasions,
  completing the rest of the homework assignment is worth an additional 2
  points, graded based on completeness and effort. Homework sets will be
  available on Canvas and are due by submitting a file in the Canvas assignment
  each Tuesday by 11:59 pm. There will be no late homework accepted. The lowest
  homework score will be dropped at the end of the term.
</p>
<p>
  Other assignments, such as an eBook Scavenger Hunt (7 points on Canvas) will
  be included in this category. If you earn 85% or more of the available
  homework points, you will earn all 60 points in the category! If you earn
  fewer than 85% of the possible points, you will receive a proportionally lower
  score. No extra credit results from accumulating a score of more than 85% of
  the points.
</p>
<h2>Participation (13%)</h2>
<p>
  Participation in class will come in three forms: attending a weekly
  recitation, answering the guiding questions, and interactions in ELMS/Piazza.
  More information on each type of participation is described below.
</p>
<h2>Weekly Recitation</h2>
<p>
  Recitations are one-hour sessions led by a pair of learning assistants via
  Zoom videoconferencing. Recitation is an opportunity to participate actively
  in problem solving and to ask questions about the material. Students will be
  assigned a recitation session according to their availability as indicated by
  a “When is Good” poll (sent to students via email prior to the start of
  classes). There will be 5-7 students in each recitation session. To be
  prepared for recitation, you should bring a copy of the recitation worksheet
  (available on ELMS), a copy of the Periodic Table and datasheet, and a
  scientific calculator. There will be 14 recitations (they will begin in week
  2). If you attend 12 of the 14 sessions, you will earn 4 all 30 points. Each
  absence beyond the first two will result in a three-point (10%) reduction of
  your recitation grade.
</p>
<h2>Guiding Questions</h2>
<p>
  Each week, there will be 2-3 “Guiding Question Sets” meant to assess your
  comprehension of the course content (reading and/or videos). These will be
  available in Canvas (also linked in ELMS) and due each Friday at 11:59 pm. If
  you earn an 85% or higher on the guiding question sets, you will receive all
  40 points available in the category. If you earn fewer than 85% of the
  possible points, you will receive a proportionally lower score. No extra
  credit results from accumulating a score of more than 85% of the points
</p>
<h2>Interactions</h2>
<p>
  Interactions include watching videos, answering embedded h5p questions in
  ELMS, and posting questions or answers to Piazza. Behind-the-scenes click data
  for users can be tracked and will be counted for this portion of the
  participation grade. We will use Piazza as a class forum/chatroom for asking
  and answering questions about the course. You can ask and answer questions
  here, which will be monitored by the TAs, LAs, and instructor. Please direct
  your questions here before e-mailing. You will be able to ask and answer
  anonymously if you wish. The beauty of Piazza is that the entire class can
  benefit from the questions and answers. More information on enrolling and
  etiquette for using will be provided during the semester. Any personal
  inquiries can be addressed by email (see below). If you interact with at least
  85% of the course content in ELMS and make a minimum of five (5) posts to
  Piazza, you will earn all 30 points in the category. If you interact with less
  than 85% of the content, you will receive a proportionally lower score.
</p>
<h2>Extra Credit (~1%)</h2>
<p>
  There will be several opportunities to earn up to a maximum of 8 extra credit
  points over the course of the semester. Opportunities will be announced as
  they come up. The number and type of assignment are at the discretion of the
  instructor.

<h2>Laboratory Investigations (75%)</h2>
<p>
  Each week, there will be an investigation to complete. All of the information
  will be provided on LabArchives. The first two weeks are considered a “dry”
  lab because there will not be an explicit experiment conducted. Most
  laboratory investigations will be worth 70 points and consist of three parts:
  notebook pages, post-lab worksheet, and a quiz. Each part is explained in more
  detail below. The deadline to submit all parts of the investigation for the
  week will be on Tuesday of the following week.
</p>
<h2>Notebook Pages (10 points)</h2>
<p>
  There will be a dedicated page in LabArchives for collecting raw data and
  recording procedural notes.
</p>
<h2>Post-lab Worksheet (50 points)</h2>
<p>
  After completing the investigation and collecting the data, you will complete
  a worksheet where you will analyze the data. Analysis may consist of
  performing calculations with the data, making graphs, and assessing accuracy
  and/or precision of results.
</p>
<h2>Quiz (10 points)</h2>
<p>
  The quiz associated with each laboratory investigation can be completed at
  anytime during the week on Canvas. You will have 20-mintues and up to two
  attempts (only the highest score will be kept). The quizzes will test your
  conceptual understanding of the investigation.
</p>
<p>
  All parts of the lab investigations will be due on Tuesdays by 11:59 pm and
  should be handed in on time. If they are not handed in on time, substantial
  penalties will apply (–10% for each day that an assignment is late). Material
  that is more than one week late will not be accepted.
</p>
<h2>Midterm Exams (10% each)</h2>
<p>
  There will be two (2) midterm exams given over the course of the semester.
  Exams are schedule on the following dates and times and will require you to
  come to campus. If you are not able to make the exam at that time, you must
  make arrangements with instructor for an alternate exam time earlier in the
  day.
</p>
<p>
  Exams will focus on material covered since the last exam; however, you are
  still responsible for information presented previously. The exams will consist
  of short answer questions and open-ended problems. Some questions may be
  multiple choice. Stay tuned to announcements for details on the format.
</p>
<h2>Participation (5%)</h2>
<p>
  We will have a class forum/chatroom for asking and answering questions about
  the course using Piazza (accessed in Canvas). You can ask and answer questions
  here, which will be monitored by the TA and instructor. Please direct your
  questions here before e-mailing. You will be able to ask and answer
  anonymously if you wish. The beauty of Piazza is that the entire class can
  benefit from the questions and answers. More information on enrolling and
  etiquette for using will be provided during the semester. You must make 10
  posts (questions or answers) anytime before October 19 to earn all 25
  participation points for the exam period. You will earn a proportionately
  lower score for fewer than 10 posts. Make an addition 10 posts (questions or
  answers) anytime between October 20 and December 7 to earn the remaining 25
  points.
</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
  The final grade is calculated based on scores in each assignment category
  (details follow).

<h2>Make-up Exams</h2>
<p>
  As required by University regulations, students who miss an exam with a valid
  excuse (family emergency, illness, university-scheduled activities, etc.) will
  be given an opportunity to make-up the exam. Prearranged make ups can be taken
  earlier in the exam week. In order to be eligible for the make-up exam ALL of
  the following conditions MUST be fulfilled:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The missed exam is the result of a University-approved excuse. Per Senate
    Policy 42-27, “Requests for missing class or an evaluative event due to
    reasons that are based on false claims may be considered violations of the
    policy on Academic Integrity”
  </li>
  <li>
    Instructor must be notified in writing (email is preferred) within 24 hours
    of the missed exam.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must schedule a make up for the exam within 1 week of the original exam
    date.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Regrades and Grade Corrections</h2>
<p>
  If after an exam or laboratory investigation is returned there is a question
  concerning the grading of the assignment, the material should be resubmitted
  to instructor for full reconsideration. Under no circumstances will anyone
  else make changes to the grades. All requests for re-grading are to be made in
  writing according to the procedure outlined below and must be submitted to
  instructor within one week of receiving the feedback. Note that the entire
  assignment will be regraded and this may result in a lower grade. Late
  re-grades will not be accepted and will not be considered at the end of the
  semester.
</p>
<p>
  The written request for a re-grade must be on a separate piece of paper. DO
  NOT ALTER THE ORIGINAL SUBMISSION. The re-grade must include an explanation as
  to why you feel the problem should be re-graded. I will not discuss with you
  whether or not you should submit a re-grade. "Brief comparisons" which consist
  of "I think I deserve more points" or “the answer is correct because my friend
  had the same answer” are NOT reconsidered.
</p>
<p>
  Note: Addition errors made during point totaling are not considered re-grades
  and may be given to the instructor for correction at any time during the
  semester.

  polls/surveys. You will get 2 extra credit points for each poll/survey you
  participate in if you do so by the corresponding lesson’s submission deadline.
  Zero points for late participation in polls/surveys. There will also be a 10
  extra credit point discussion forum associated with lesson 12.
</p>
<p>
  Use proper English when writing assignments, participating in class
  discussions and completing exams; achieving competence in the use of the
  English language is one of the objectives of general education at Penn State.
  Improper use of the English language, including more than a few minor spelling
  and grammatical errors, will adversely affect your grade.
</p>
