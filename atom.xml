  Louis Leblond is the Director of Online Education in Physics. With a strong
  passion for all things education (research and online), he teaches large
  enrollment intro physics courses and has worked tirelessly to enhance them
  with engaging, accessible, and innovative materials.
</p>
<p>
  Louis excells in creating unique online course experiences to enrich
  face-to-face classes and currently he is working on developing a hands-on lab
  for future physics online courses.

  Moreover, when Loius isn't pouring over his course materials for quality and
  effectiveness, he's working to create resources for fellow faculty to improve
  the college.

  The 2020 Horizon Report has just been released, taking a look at what may be
  impacting teaching and learning in the future. This report is very important
  in the digital world as it helps stakeholders learn, plan, and act on
  initiatives or developments that may influence higher education. The report
  summarizes trends that are unfolding as we speak: Social, Technological,
  Economic, Higher Education, and Political. Additionally, it takes a look at
  emerging technologies and practices that will have significant impact on the
  future of postsecondary education.
</p>
<p>
  The Office of Digital Learning is familiar with many of these emerging
  technologies, including NGDLEs, AI, Analytics, and online education. We hope
  you have a moment or two to download and look at the report. As always, we are
  interested in your thoughts and ways you think we can have an impact on the
  future of higher education.

  / NARA) to present work on web components.
</p>
<p>
  Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create custom,
  reusable, HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Because they’re built
  using web standards, they will work across all modern browsers and within any
  JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML. The team has been
  actively working to implement web components across a number of projects,
  including a custom suite of authoring tools (<a
    href="https://haxtheweb.org/"
    target="_blank"
    >HAX</a
  >
  ), Drupal, WordPress, Grav CMS and more.
</p>
<p>
  Bryan Ollendyke jump-started the conversation with a great introduction and
  Michael Potter and I showcased our implementation of web components across
  several custom web themes. The highlight of the talk was Rebecca Goodman
  announcing that her web team at NARA had started implementing web components
  into their work-flow by successfully placing a branding bar across several of
  their existing web properties.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, feedback was extremely positive. The audience contained a wide
  variety of technical backgrounds. Developers quickly understood how they could
  reduce technical debt across their projects, graphic designers saw how their
  interactions with Content Management Systems could be simplified, and project
  managers realized how this approach could reduce timelines of maintenance and
  enhancement across the board.

  This past weekend (February 1-3) the Office of Digital Learning (Eberly
  College of Science at Penn State) participated in the eighth consecutive
  <a href="https://www.drupalcampnj.org/" target="_blank">Drupal Camp NJ</a>



, hosted at Princeton University. The annual event brings
  developers and industry professionals from varying backgrounds and
  skill-levels together to share all things <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a>


 through engaging
  presentations, co-working sessions, and networking.
</p>
<p>
  This year there were a number of great discussions to get involved with, but
  one topic continued to dominate the conversation - decoupling Drupal.
  Decoupling Drupal essentially means separating Drupal’s front-end (theme
  layer) from it’s back-end (data/content layer) using a custom JavaScript
  framework. While there are still some discussions as to which framework is
  ‘best’ when decoupling Drupal, the general consensus is that the decoupled
  method is becoming an industry-wide movement.
</p>
<p>
  Jesus Manuel Olivas (Head of Products at <a href="https://weknowinc.com/" target="_blank">weKnow</a>

) showcased decoupling tools
  like <a href="http://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>
 and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/tome" target="_blank">Tome</a>
. These tools assist in creating static sites by
  decoupling Drupal’s theme and just using Drupal for content creation.
</p>
<p>
  Saurabh Chugh and Surendra Singh hosted a discussion, ‘Decoupling Patterns,
  Services and creating an enterprise level editorial experience’ where they
  also emphasized using decoupled applications to display content.

</p>
<p>
  Our team demonstrated decoupled development when Michal Potter and Charles
  Lavera joined ELMS:LN lead developer, Bryan Ollendyke (College of Arts and
  Architecture - Penn State) to present work on web components. Specifically,
  the trio discussed the tooling they use to quickly generate and publish their
  components onto the web (<a href="https://github.com/elmsln/wcfactory" target="_blank">WCFactory</a>
 / Drupal <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/webcomponents" target="_blank">webcomponents module</a>
). In
  addition, Bryan explored the future of content-authoring with a completely
  headless authoring experience called HAX.

    this video, I set up a simple
    demonstration that identifies some basic goals while also asking users to
    supply their insight as they traverse
    through each step. Specifically, we look over the general settings of the
    tool and work through building an
    example that will help users scaffold out a detailed steps-to-completion
    outline, create a plan of attack, and
    organize / assess individual goals and contributions. At the end, we'll
    review the different ways we can
    implement this newly created content into your website. Check it out!

  Science. From there, Michael joined a local venture capital group where he was
  involved with many different companies and handled everything from sales, to
  product development, to logistics and shipping. When one such company lost
  their only web developer, Michael was tapped to takeover the programming
  responsibilities and the rest is history. Michael was immediately hooked with
  web development and begin soaking up every piece of information the web could
  offer.

  I have always been obsessed with visuals. When I was a kid I would go through
  my mom’s magazines, find an image I loved, check with my mom to make sure she
  didn’t need the article on the back, then clip it out and safely tuck it away
  in a flat, waxed-cardboard box under my bed - only to find out years later
  that my mom secretly snuck in my room and downsized my collection to keep it
  under control.

  These days, I apply my passion for visual arts to graphic design and
  photography. I soak up inspiration all around me, and still tear out magazine
  ads and tuck them away for reference. I strive to visually present the facts
  and discipline of science with creativity, quality, technology and whenever
  possible… a bit of humor. I am always looking for new ways to approach
  courses, graphics, and content to successfully visually communicate concepts

</table>
<p>
  Not every week will contain all different types of assignments. For an exam
  week, the exam is on Thursday (on the material of the previous weeks).
</p>
<p>
  Most of the material is posted ahead and it is entirely possible for you to
  adjust this schedule to fit better with your own work/study schedule.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Reading Quiz</h2>
<p>
  We will be using an online computer grading system called MasteringPhysics
  (https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/) to do reading quiz . Access to
  MasteringPhysics is provided in the PSU custom book in the bookstore.
</p>
<p>
  The reading quiz are due early in the week and they are meant to be places to
  first learn the material, not a place to “test” your knowledge. Most of the
  questions are “tutorials” that will walk you through how to solve problems.
  You get immediate feedback when answering questions and many questions provide
  hints.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Tutorial</h2>
<p>
  Each week, we will have a tutorial. There are three options on how to do the
  tutorials:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Print it and write your answer by hand, take a picture (or a scan) and
    submit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a blank sheet, write your answer by hand clearly numbering them. Take a
    pic or scan and submit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using a tablet, write your answer by hand on the tutorial pdf and submit.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In this type of assignments, we will grade your work and not just your answer.
  If you have a real professional scanner, that will work great. If we have to
  use a phone we recommend to use scanning app which do better than just
  pictures.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Labs</h2>
<p>
  The laboratories (8 in total) are designed to provide you with hands-on
  experience with the material being investigated in class as well as teaching
  data sensemaking and observational experimental methods. See the list of
  learning objectives for more details. All of those skills and topics learned
  in the lab may be tested in the exams. The lab will be using the IOLab device
  various sensors together with the accompanying software. While the lab
  component is officially only worth 10% of the grade, a zero on all labs will
  result in a letter grade of D at best irrespective of all other course work.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Peer-Review</h2>
<p>
  It is very beneficial for students to see each other works and to receive and
  give feedback. Therefore, a first draft of the weekly tutorial and lab is
  required to be posted every Saturday. You will then be randomly assigned to
  peer-review multiple of your peers and give feedback on their work (not grade
  their work which is only a draft anyway). The instructors will also review
  each draft submission and help out where needed. The tutorial and lab will
  then be resubmitted for grading every Tuesday. The peer-review is graded and
  is part of the quiz grade. As you will see, there are some points every week
  in the quiz assigned to a peer-review question.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Discussion Boards</h2>
<p>
  Maybe the most important part of this course is the weekly discussion board.
  You will be assigned a team and you will need to post and reply to your
  teammates.
</p>
<p>Often the post will include three parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your answers and reasoning to a couple of conceptual questions on the
    material
  </li>
  <li>Comments/questions on your work on the tutorial</li>
  <li>Comments/questions on your work on the lab</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Instructor and TA will provide feedback in the discussion boards. The
  discussion boards are the online analog of a lecture where the students
  discuss with continuous instructor feedback.
</p>
<p>
  The first post of the discussion is due on Wednesday but replies will continue
  as long as needed.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Quiz</h2>
<p>
  There will be individual quizzes throughout the semester with questions that
  closely resembled the exams. These are graded on correctness. You get two
  tries and the best score is kept. The quiz will also self-reflections
  questions and this is where the points for the peer-review will be attributed.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">TA Sessions</h2>
<p>
  These are required live discussions once a week where we will review previous
  material and look ahead to the upcoming week. These sessions will be hosted by
  teaching assistanta and the instructor. We will have multiple time options.
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Discussions with Professor</h2>
<p>
  I will host a discussion hour on Thursdays (not graded or required but very
  useful). These may be recorded but I will need students to start the
  discussions!
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Exams</h2>
<p>
  There will be two midterm exams. Both midterms are worth the same: 20% each
  for a total of 40%.
</p>
<p>
  Exams will be closed book. Relevant physical constants and formulae will be
  provided. Calculators, cellular phones and other communication devices are NOT
  allowed and the exam will be designed such that they are not needed. The exams
  will be based on the assigned reading in the textbook, the material covered in
  course content, the quizzes, discussion boards and the laboratories/tutorial.
</p>
<p>
  Each exam will be delivered through Canvas. All exams are proctored using
  Examity which allow you to take the exam anywhere and to schedule at any time
  (in the appropriate time window where the exam is opened).
</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 400;">Grading</h2>
<p>
  Your grade in the course will be based on your performance in the
  labs/tutorials, on the quizzes, on the discussion boards/wrap-ups/peer-reviews
  and on the exams with the following weights:

<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Backward Design</h3>
<p>
  Backward design is a pedagogical approach where instructors begin with the
  end, their learning outcomes, in mind. By identifying outcomes and the initial
  learning goals, instructors can figure out appropriate ways to fill in the
  required elements for instructions and make sure the content is aligned toward
  what the students need to learn to succeed in the course. Review the

  </a>.
</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 400;">LinkedIn Learning</h3>
<p>
  LinkedIn Learning, formerly Lynda.com has a nice tutorial about putting your
  course content online. Interested in taking your training program to the
  online space? In this course, join instructor Samantha Calamari as she steps
  through how to design engaging elearning content that connects with a diverse
  set of participants. To begin, Samantha helps you determine if elearning is
  the right approach for your training program. She then acquaints you with key
  instructional design methods and theories, explaining how to apply them in
  your design process. Next, she shows how to organize the learning experience
  and design content that effectively delivers information to learners. Discover
  how to approach tone and engagement, create an active learning environment,
  design assessments that enrich your learner's experience, and more.
