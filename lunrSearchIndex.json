This requires the language and notation of matrices and fundamental techniques for working with matrices such as row and column operations, echelon form, and invertibility. The determinant of a matrix is also introduced; it gives a test for invertibility. In the second part of the course the key ideas of eigenvector and eigenvalue are developed. These allow one to analyze a complicated matrix problem into simpler components and appear in many disguises in physical problems. The course also introduces the concept of a vector space, a crucial element in future linear algebra courses.

Today, differential equations are one of the fundamental mathematical tools for the study of systems that change over time, and are used in most areas of science, engineering, and mathematics. MATH 250 is an introductory course on ordinary differential equations. Ordinary differential equations are equations that involve derivative of a function with respect to only one variable.

Almost by definition, the vast majority of microorganisms are too small to be seen with the naked eye. Therefore, students must learn the correct use of the light microscope. Instruction in the proper care and maintenance of the microscope is provided. Students prepare and stain specimens using a number of methods designed to characterize microorganisms. The importance of working safely in a laboratory setting is emphasized throughout the course.Many skills are developed in this laboratory course. Aseptic (without contamination) technique is taught and is used to transfer organisms properly from one culture medium to another. A variety of media are used and the reasons for their use are explained. Students also learn how to calculate the number of bacteria in specimens such as water, soil or food. The course demonstrates ways to control microbial growth by means of temperature, osmotic pressure, pH, exposure to ultraviolet light and disinfectants.","text":"micrb107 "},{"id":"phys010","title":"Phys 010","created":1541517755,"location":"courses\/phys010","description":"This course is an introduction for non-science majors to select topics in the modern physics of quantum mechanics and relativity with the goal of understanding recent technological advances, scientific breakthroughs and social events related to science as they appear in the news. These range from the discovery of the Higgs boson and dark energy to developments in lasers or superconductors. Social events in the news where science played a large role such as the Roswell \u201cUFO\u201d event in 1947 or the Fukushima nuclear crisis in 2011 will also be discussed. Students will learn about the scientific method and scientific reporting; the conceptual aspects of the structure of matter from atoms to quarks, waves, energy and light; quantum mechanics and its applications to high tech such as computers and lasers; relativity E=mc2, nuclear forces, gravity and the Big-Bang theory. Particular emphasis will be put on learning the scientific standards for a hypothesis to be truly established as a working theory and how the simple laws of physics apply broadly to many different systems. This class will emphasize conceptual aspects and there is no mathematics prerequisite. This course is for non-science majors.","text":"phys010 "},{"id":"phys211","title":"Phys 211","created":1541517755,"location":"courses\/phys211","description":"This course provides a calculus-based introduction to classical mechanics, including such topics as: measurement, dimensional analysis, motion in one-dimension, vectors, motion in 2 and 3 dimensions, relative and circular motion, force and dynamics, Newton's Laws, friction, kinetic energy, work, potential energy, energy conservation, systems of particles, center of mass and momentum, elastic and inelastic collisions, rotation (moments of inertia), rolling motion, torque, angular momentum, static equilibrium, gravitational force and Kepler's laws, gravitational potential energy, oscillations, waves (transverse and longitudinal, superposition of waves). PHYS 211 is designed to provide students with a working knowledge of the elementary physics principles mentioned above, as well as their applications, and to enhance their conceptual understanding of physical laws.","text":"phys211 "},{"id":"syllabi","title":"Syllabi","created":1541517755,"location":"syllabi","description":"","text":""},{"id":"astro001syllabi","title":"Astro 001","created":1541517755,"location":"syllabi\/astro001","description":"","text":"astro001 syllabi"},{"id":"astro011syllabi","title":"Astro 011","created":1541517755,"location":"syllabi\/astro011","description":"","text":"astro011 syllabus "},{"id":"astro120syllabi","title":"Astro 120","created":1541517755,"location":"syllabi\/astro120","description":"","text":"astro120 syllabus "},{"id":"astro130syllabi","title":"Astro 130","created":1541517755,"location":"syllabi\/astro130","description":"","text":"astro130 syllabus "},{"id":"astro140syllabi","title":"Astro 140","created":1541517755,"location":"syllabi\/astro140","description":"Course ContentThe possible existence of life beyond Earth is one of the most fundamental questions relating the human race to the physical Universe around us.
